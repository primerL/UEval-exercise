    "text_ref": "1. Start down on all fours with your hands just wider than your shoulders. Find a comfortable spot on the floor to exercise and get on your hands and knees. Put your palms flat against the ground so they’re directly below your shoulders. Point your fingers point straight ahead. Look straight down, and try your best to keep your head and neck in line with your back. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Do push-ups on an exercise mat to cushion your hands and wrists so they don’t get sore. 2. Extend your legs so they form a straight line with your back. Walk your feet back as far as you can. Position your feet right next to each other or a few inches apart, and balance your weight on the balls of your feet. Keep your legs and back as straight as possible throughout your entire set of push-ups. Avoid raising your hips too high or letting them sag too low so that your body goes out of line. 3. Lower yourself to the floor until your elbows are at 90 degrees. Engage your core and breathe in as you bend your elbows. Keep your back and legs straight as you bring your body down toward the ground. Stop when your chest is about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) from the floor. Try to take about 2 seconds to lower yourself down so you have more control over your movements. 4. Push yourself back up until your arms are straight. Breathe out as you push your hands firmly against the floor. Lift your body up without bending your knees, letting your hips sag, or raising your hips up. Once you straighten out your arms and are back in your starting position, you’ve completed 1 rep! Avoid locking your elbows when you return to your starting position since you could risk injuring them. If your arms start shaking or you can’t fully get back into your starting position, don’t sweat it. Try putting your knees down to make it easier or lower yourself back to the floor and take a break before trying again. 5. Try to do as many push-ups as you can with good form. See how many push-ups you can do in a row without breaking your form to find a good starting point. Add the exercise to your routine, and take a rest day between each time you do them. As the push-ups start getting more manageable, try adding more reps or additional sets to your routine to challenge yourself and build more muscle. [3] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source For a good starting point, try doing 5–10 push-ups at a time. Once that starts feeling easy, try adding 5 reps at a time.",

Brace\n\n* Inhale through your nose.\n* “Screw” your palms into the floor (like twisting jars open) to engage lats.\n* Keep shoulder blades slightly protracted (rounded forward a touch) and core tight.\n\n3. Lower\n\n* Keep elbows ~30–45° from your torso.\n* Lower in control until your chest is a fist’s height from the floor; hips and chest descend together.\n* Forearms stay vertical; no sagging or piking.\n\n4. Drive Up\n\n* Exhale as you press the floor away.\n* Keep your body rigid—don’t let hips lead or lag.\n* Finish with elbows straight without hyperextending.\n\n5.

Pull in your abs. Keep your back straight in a neutral position throughout the exercise. 3. Lower yourself in a controlled manner. As you go down, push your hips back. [2] X Expert Source Tiffany Stafford, CPT Life Coach, Personal Trainer, & Holistic Nutritionist Expert Interview Go as low as your body can while still keeping your shins vertical and your heels on the ground. From the lower position, push up off your heels and slowly rise up, balancing by leaning forward as necessary. If you can, aim to lower yourself until your hips sink beneath your knees. If you are just starting out, you may not be flexible enough to go this low. Work your way up to this level. Inhale as you lower. Exhale as you rise. Look forward as you squat to help keep your form correct. Extend your arms straight forward to help your balance. This will also help you keep your shins vertical. If you're losing your balance or want additional support, put a chair or workout bench right behind your legs. When you lower yourself down, push your hips back into the seat. [5] X Expert Source Tiffany Stafford, CPT Life Coach, Personal Trainer, & Holistic Nutritionist Expert Interview 4. Repeat. If you're a beginner, you may want to aim for ten reps. If you're fit, you can aim for 15-30 reps each set. Do one to three sets. Remember to rest between sets.",

The bottom position\n\n* Go to your comfortable depth (aim for thighs parallel or just below if mobility allows).\n* Pause briefly while staying braced; hips under control, not tucked hard.\n* Shins and torso should feel like they’re leaning similarly (roughly parallel angles).\n\n5. Stand up strong\n\n* Exhale as you rise; “push the floor away.”\n* Drive through mid-foot/heels, knees still tracking out.\n* Hips and chest rise together—don’t let hips shoot up first.\n* Finish tall, squeeze glutes lightly, reset, and repeat.\n\nQuick cues: “Brace—hips back—knees out—heels down—push the floor.”\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid: letting knees cave in, heels lifting, collapsing the chest/rounding the back, or bouncing at the bottom.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a version showing goblet or barbell squats next.\n",

Keep your chest up, shoulders back and down, and engage your core. Look straight ahead.\n\n**Step 2: Descend**\nInitiate the movement by pushing your hips back as if you're going to sit in a chair. Simultaneously, bend your knees. Keep your chest lifted and your back straight. Aim to get your thighs at least parallel to the floor, or deeper if your mobility allows without compromising form. Ensure your knees track in line with your toes and don't collapse inward.\n\n**Step 3: Bottom Position**\nAt the bottom of the squat, your weight should be evenly distributed through your feet, primarily in your heels and mid-foot. Your chest should remain upright, and your lower back should maintain its natural arch (not rounded). Your knees should be out, following the line of your toes.\n\n**Step 4: Ascend**\nTo return to the starting position, drive through your heels and push your hips forward, squeezing your glutes at the top. Keep your core tight and maintain a straight back throughout the ascent. Stand up fully, but avoid locking out your knees forcefully.\n\n",

Place **forearms on the floor**, elbows directly under shoulders. Hands parallel (either palms flat or lightly make fists).\n\n2. Brace before you lift\n\n* Take a small inhale. On the exhale, **brace your core** like you’re about to be lightly poked in the stomach.\n* Squeeze glutes and lightly **tuck the pelvis** (posterior tilt) to keep the low back neutral.\n* Press the floor away so your shoulder blades spread slightly (no shoulder shrug).\n\n3. Step back to plank\n\n* Extend one leg back, then the other so you’re on your toes.\n* Feet hip-width apart (wider is easier for balance).\n\n4. Find your straight line\n\n* Ears-to-ankles in one line: **neck long, gaze down**, ribs stacked over pelvis, hips neither sagging nor piked.\n* Keep quads tight and heels pushing back.\n\n5. Breathe & hold\n\n* Breathe quietly—**3–4 second inhale, 3–5 second exhale**.\n* Hold for **10–30 seconds** with perfect form. Rest, then do 2–4 sets. (Advance toward 30–60 seconds if pain-free and form is solid.)\n\n6. Finish\n\n* Gently **lower your knees** to the mat, then sit back and relax the shoulders.\n\n### Quick checkpoints\n\n* Elbows under shoulders\n* Ribs down, pelvis slightly tucked\n* Hips level with shoulders\n* Head in line with spine\n* Steady breathing\n\n### Common mistakes (avoid)\n\n* Sagging or hiking the hips\n* Letting the low back arch or the head drop\n* Shrugging into the neck or collapsing through the shoulders\n* Holding your breath\n\n### Easier options\n\n* **Knee plank** (knees on the mat, same alignment)\n* **Hands elevated** on a bench or countertop (high plank)\n\n### Harder options (when ready)\n\n* **High plank** on hands\n* **Side plank** (stack feet, elbow under shoulder)\n* **Single-leg or shoulder tap** holds while keeping hips still\n\nIf anything hurts—especially your lower back—stop, reset your alignment, or choose an easier option.\n",

Relax your shoulders and allow your shoulder blades to sink down towards your hips. Keep yourself in this position by flexing your abdominal muscles to keep your spine straight and stable. [2] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Throughout a lunge exercise your arms and hands can be in any position that helps you maintain your balance. Some people may prefer to put their hands on their hips while others may prefer to keep their arms held out to the side or in front of them. Keep your back straight throughout a lunge exercise. This means you should try to keep your head upright while looking straight ahead; however, if you need to look down to ensure you’re in the right position, that’s okay. Some people find it helpful to stare at a particular space on a wall (or another object) directly in front of them to help keep their balance. 2. Take a big step forward with your right leg. Place your right foot on the ground, heel first. Lean your body forward so that about 70% of your weight is on your front foot. Keep your back and upper body straight. Hold this position. [4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source 3. Lower your body until your right knee is at a 90-degree angle. While keeping your upper body and back straight, continue to move your body forward until your right upper leg (thigh) is parallel to the floor. You may need to bend your hips slightly to stay in this position, but keep your back straight. [6] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not to move your right knee past your toes. Your right knee should be positioned directly above your right ankle. Once in the lunge position, your left (back) knee should also form a 90-degree angle, but your lower leg (shin) will be parallel to the ground while your upper leg (thigh) will be perpendicular to the ground. Due to the position you’re in, you will only be able to keep your left toes on the ground. Your left heel will lift off the ground as you lean forward. 4. Push yourself upwards with your right foot. Use your right foot to push yourself upwards. Return your body to the position you started in, standing straight with your feet hip-width apart. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source 5. Repeat the forward lunge. Once you’ve completed a lunge with your right leg, you can either switch sides and perform a lunge with your left leg, or you can continue to work your right side. It doesn’t matter what order you do lunges in, but try to do an equal number of lunges using both your left and right side before you finish. [10] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Another alternative is to do a stationary lunge. Instead of stepping forward and back each time, rise up from the lunge by straightening your legs, but don't change the positioning of your feet. Then lower back down into the lunge by returning to bent knees. Repeat this several times and then switch to your left side.",

Step\n\n* Take a comfortable step forward (roughly a normal stride) and keep feet hip-width—don’t line them up like a tightrope. Plant the whole front foot.\n\n3. Lower\n\n* Drop straight down by bending both knees. Keep torso upright and spine neutral.\n* Aim for about 90° at both knees; back heel stays lifted and weight centered.\n\n4. Knee check\n\n* Front knee tracks over the midfoot (in line with 2nd–3rd toe), not caving inward and not shooting far past the toes.\n* Back knee points straight down, under the hip, hovering 1–2 in (3–5 cm) from the floor.\n\n5. Drive back\n\n* Press through the front heel, squeeze the front-leg glute, and return to standing without rocking forward.\n\n6. Repeat\n\n* Alternate legs for the desired reps.\n* Breathe: inhale as you lower, exhale as you drive up.\n\n### Quick cues\n\n* “Zip up your core,” “torso tall,” “knee tracks toes,” “push through heel,” “hips like headlights—facing forward.”\n\n### Common mistakes → fixes\n\n* Knee collapses inward → Press the knee out slightly; imagine screwing the front foot into the floor.\n* Feet on a tightrope → Keep hip-width stance for balance.\n* Front heel lifts → Shorten your step and sit down, not forward.\n* Leaning forward → Brace, eyes ahead, and think “drop the back knee.”\n\n### Scaling & progressions\n\n* Easier: reverse lunge (step back), shallow depth, hold a chair/wall, or do stationary split squats.\n* Harder: add dumbbells, walking lunges, or rear-foot-elevated (Bulgarian) split squats.\n\n### Sets & reps (general guidance)\n\n* Beginners: 2–3 sets of 8–10 reps per leg, resting 60–90 s.\n* Focus on smooth control—quality over depth.\n\nIf you’ve got cranky knees or a history of pain, start with reverse lunges or split squats and keep the range pain-free.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Lie flat on the floor and lace your hands behind your head. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview Spread your elbows wide as you bring your hands behind your head. Lightly touch the back of your head with your fingers and palms. Try to relax as you look straight up at the ceiling so you're not holding tension in your shoulders. If it's more comfortable, you can lie on a lightly cushioned surface. For example, lie down on a yoga mat or carpeted floor. If you keep your elbows tucked in, your crunches won't engage your oblique muscles as well. Avoid interlacing your fingers because you'll be more likely to pull on your neck. This can cause muscle strain or fatigue. 2. Bend your knees up at a 90-degree angle. Keep your feet planted on the floor as you bring your knees up so they form the peak of a triangle. Your feet should be flat and about shoulder-width apart on the floor. Your knees shouldn't be knocking together once they're at a 90-degree angle. Instead, keep space between them. 3. Lift your legs up and away from your body. Once your knees are bent, lift your feet up so your legs are extended and slightly bent at the knee. Avoid straightening your legs so much that your hamstrings feel tight. 4. Bring your right knee to your chest and touch your left elbow to it. [6] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview Twist your torso as you draw in your knee. At the same time, rotate your left elbow to touch your right knee. Your shoulder blades should be raised off the floor so your abs are getting stretched instead of your arms. 5. Alternate the crunch by touching the other knee with the opposite elbow. [8] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview Release the crunch and bring your other knee in towards your chest as you touch the opposite elbow to it. Extend the leg that's not tucked in so it's pushed away from your body as though you're pedaling a bike. Once you get the hang of it, you can smoothly rotate your torso as your elbows touch alternating knees. 6. Aim for 15 to 20 crunches per set. If you're just starting out with bicycle crunches try to do 1 to 2 sets. Then, work your way up to at least 3 or 4 sets of 15 to 20 crunches for a more challenging workout that builds your abs. It's okay to adjust the number of crunches you perform for each set. For example, you might prefer to start with 10 crunches per set.",

Focus on keeping your hips over your heels and relax your pelvis. 2. Jump and press your legs out and arms up. With your feet shoulder-width apart, slightly bend your knees so you can hop. As you jump, open your legs wider than shoulder width and lift your arms overhead. To avoid injury, keep your joints loose. Don’t hold your arms or knees stick-straight; keep them slightly bent. 3. Jump again and land in the starting position. Press up off the floor to hop again. As you do this, bring your arms down and your feet back in beneath your shoulders. You should land in the position you started in. 4. Repeat the jumping motion. The more jumping jacks you do, the more cardio you’ll perform! Keep jumping as a way to warm up before a workout or run, or simply do them for fun to get your heart pumping. Aim to do jumping jacks for 10 to 20 minutes for a cardio exercise. Do jumping jacks for about 5 minutes if you’re warming up for a more intense workout.",

    "text_ref": "1. Get into plank position. Get down on the floor on your hands and knees. Extend your legs out behind you, balancing on the balls and toes. Place your hands directly under your shoulders with your fingers facing forward and slightly outward. Keep your core engaged by squeezing your stomach muscles. Your body should be in a straight line from your crown to your heels. Don’t allow your body to come out of alignment. A sagging butt or V-shaped hip angle are symptoms of bad form. Hold your arms strong and straight, but don’t lock your elbows. This could lead to injury. 2. Pull one knee up and in toward your midsection. Lift one foot and begin bending the knee as you pull it up between the front of your body and the floor. Bring the knee forward in one smooth, controlled motion. Don’t let either of your knees sag or come into contact with the floor. Once you’ve raised your knee as far as you can, contract and hold your abs briefly but forcefully. If possible, try to touch the top of your thigh to your chest. Resistance is created by gravity to work the core muscles, quadriceps, hip flexors, and glutes, while the chest, deltoids, lats, and lower back are responsible for stabilizing the plank position. 3. Repeat the action with your other knee. Relax your midsection and push your knee back toward your other foot slowly. Straight your leg and set your foot back on the ground behind you. Then, bring the other knee forward, moving fluidly and squeezing your abs. You should have one foot on the floor at all times to serve as your base. 4. Continue alternating the movement with both knees. Return your leg to the floor behind you and begin pulling the opposite knee up once more. Repeat this motion until you get comfortable with it. That’s it! Do as many mountain climbers as you can before you tire out, and try to increase the number over time. This exercise makes a welcome addition to any strength and conditioning workout. Mountain climbers take their name from their resemblance to the techniques used to scale steep mountainsides. Once you start getting the hang of it, you can increase your speed until your legs are bounding rather than moving one at a time.",

Also, make sure to tighten your abs, keep your back flat, and squeeze your buttocks at the start of each burpee. Check your position in a mirror or ask a personal trainer for feedback if you are doing burpees at the gym. 2. Bend at your hips and knees to lower yourself into a squatting position. Hinge forward with your hips and bend your knees slightly to bring your body down lower to the floor. Keep your back straight and your arms in close to your body as you do this. [2] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview 3. Place your hands on the floor in front of you. Keep your hands close together so they are directly under your shoulders when you place them on the ground. Hold your arms out straight, but don't lock out your elbows. 4. Kick your feet back so that you are in the plank position. Jump both feet back behind you at the same time and position them about shoulder-width apart. Keep your hands planted firmly on the ground to support your body as you do this. [4] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview Check your position in a mirror once you are down on the floor. Your body should be in a straight line from your head to your feet. If your hips and butt are elevated above the rest of your body, lower them slightly. 5. Drop all the way down to the floor. Once you are in the plank position, carefully lower your chest all the way down to the floor to do a pushup. Keep your hands flat on the floor with your elbows up in the air and your arms close to your body. [6] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview 6. Press up with your arms and jump your feet forward. Keep your hands flat on the ground and push off from the ground with your hand as you hinge forward at the hips and jump your feet towards your chest. Do this in 1 smooth motion. [7] X Expert Source Pete Cerqua Certified Personal Trainer & Nutritionist Expert Interview This part of the burpee is sometimes called a frog jump. 7. Jump straight upwards to finish the move. Once your feet are back under your upper body, jump straight up with your hands and arms raised over your head and then land in the standing position. You can jump as high as you are able, or just do a little hop in the air to finish the burpee. Make sure to keep your core engaged as you do this. Flex your abs and stand up tall when you jump. 8. Do 15 repetitions to complete 1 set of burpees. If you are a beginner, you might want to start off with doing 5 burpees in a row. Or, you can do 15 burpees for a set, and then do 2 to 3 more sets during your workout. Another option is to time yourself doing burpees, such as for 30 seconds. As you get stronger, you can do burpees for longer stretches.",

    "text_ref": "1. Sit on the edge of a sturdy chair or bench. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview Bring your arms down along your sides and rest your palms on your chair, wrapping your fingers under the front of the seat. Straighten your legs out in front of you and place your heels firmly on the ground. Your seat should be stable enough that it doesn’t topple forward while you work. A workout bench is ideal if you have access to one. If you don't have a chair or bench, the edge of your bed will work too. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 2. Scoot your buttocks off the chair, supporting yourself with your hands. Driving your weight into the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet, move your bottom forward until it’s completely off the chair. Keep your elbows tucked behind you, your shoulder blades back and down, and your forearms perpendicular to the floor. Position your hands so that your fingers are facing forward rather than out to the side. 3. Lower yourself by bending your elbows back until they reach a 90-degree angle. Engage your triceps as you dip down so that your lowering motion is slow and controlled. Keep your elbows tucked straight back behind you instead of letting them flare out to get the best control for this exercise. Don’t let your bottom touch the floor. If you can’t get down to a 90-degree angle to start, that’s perfectly normal. It’s better to not dip all the way to 90-degrees than to dip too far too fast. 4. Straighten your elbows fully to lift yourself back up. Pause for 1-2 seconds at the bottom of your dip to make sure your motions are in-control. Then, engage your triceps to press your body back up, bringing your arms straight. Straighten your arm completely at the top of the move. 5. Repeat 5-7 times. If you are a beginner, start by building your strength rather than going all-out with tricep dips. Start your routine with 5-7 dips per set. Once you feel like you can safely and comfortably complete that, gradually increase the number of dips you do by 1 or 2 at a time.",

Knees bent, feet flat (easier) or legs straight (harder).\n\n2. Start position\n\n* Arms straight but not locked.\n* Brace your core; keep your back close to the chair.\n\n3. Lower (inhale)\n\n* Bend your elbows straight back, keeping them tucked near your sides.\n* Lower until upper arms are roughly parallel to the floor (about 90° at the elbows).\n* Keep shoulders away from ears; torso stays upright and close to the chair.\n\n4. Press up (exhale)\n\n* Drive through your palms to extend your elbows, returning to the start without locking out.\n* Squeeze triceps at the top.\n\n5. Reps & sets\n\n* Do 8–12 reps for 2–3 sets, resting 60–90 seconds. Stop if you feel sharp shoulder pain.\n\n6. Make it easier/harder\n\n* Easier: bend knees more, move feet closer.\n* Harder: straighten legs, elevate heels on another chair/step, or slow the lowering phase.\n\n7. Form cues & common mistakes\n\n* Cues: elbows back, ribs down, neck long, back close to chair.\n* Avoid: flared elbows, shrugging, dipping too low, or letting the chair slide.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a second image showing “easier vs harder” variations.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Stand with your back flat against a wall. 2. Walk your feet out about 2 feet in front of you, feet spread about 6 inches apart. . 3. Slide your back down the wall, bending your knees until they are bent at about a 90 degree angle. Your thighs should be parallel to the ground and it should appear that you are sitting in an invisible chair. Your knees should never extend past your ankles--they should be straight above your ankles. You may need to slide further up or down on the wall to get into this position. This position strengthens your quadriceps on the front of your thigh and your hamstrings on the back of your thigh, which can help prevent damage to your knees. These muscles are necessary for everyday actions like standing and walking, so it's important to keep them in good shape. 4. Hold this seated position for 20-60 seconds, contracting your abdominal muscles. Your thighs will start to burn after 20 seconds, but try to stick it out for the full 60. 5. Straighten your legs and come back to a standing lean against the wall. Rest for 30 seconds, then repeat. Try to do 5 sits at 60 seconds each, or until your muscles become too fatigued to hold the sitting position. If a trainer or doctor has instructed you to do a different number of sits for a different length of time, follow their orders. This is simply a guideline to get you started. 6. Change the angle of your bent knees to change the intensity of the exercise. Instead of repeating the move and bending your knees to 90 degrees each time, first slide down the wall only a couple of inches. The next rep, slide a little bit further down, and so on.",

If knees pass the toes, move feet farther forward.\n6. **Heels stay down.**\n\n## Align & engage\n\n7. **Press your lower back and pelvis gently into the wall** (slight posterior tilt) so your ribs aren’t flared.\n8. **Chest open, shoulders down**, head neutral with a light chin tuck.\n9. **Arms** crossed over chest or hanging by sides (not on thighs).\n10. **Brace your core** as if preparing for a cough; **squeeze glutes lightly**; **press knees out** so they track over the middle toes.\n\n## Hold\n\n11. Breathe quietly through the nose: **inhale 3–4 s, exhale 3–4 s** while keeping the brace.\n12. Hold **20–45 seconds** per set (or to a steady burn without losing form).\n\n## Finish\n\n13. To come up, **push through your heels**, keep the back against the wall for the first half, then stand tall.\n\n---\n\n## Common mistakes → quick fixes\n\n* **Knees cave inward** → “Screw” feet into floor and **press knees out** to track over middle toes.\n* **Heels lift** → Move feet farther forward and think **weight in heels**.\n* **Back arches / ribs flare** → **Tuck pelvis slightly** and press lower back to wall; exhale to set ribs down.\n* **Hands on thighs** → Remove; it offloads the legs and rounds shoulders.\n* **Head jutting forward** → Light **chin tuck** and touch the back of the head to the wall.\n\n## Programming tips (optional)\n\n* Do **2–4 sets**, rest **45–60 s** between.\n* Progress when you can hold 45–60 s cleanly:\n\n  * **Add load** (hold a dumbbell at chest).\n  * **Calf-raise wall sit** (lift both heels, keep knees stacked).\n  * **Single-leg wall sit** (extend one leg; keep hips level).\n\n## Safety notes\n\n* Stop if you feel joint pain (sharp or pinching at knees/hips).\n* If you have knee issues, try a **higher seat angle** (thighs slightly above parallel) and shorter holds.\n\nIf you want, I can also create a second image focused just on **“mistakes and fixes”** as a quick-reference card.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Lie on your back. Get into the starting position for the glute bridge by lying flat on the floor with your legs extended and your arms by your sides. It's a good idea to use an exercise or yoga mat for cushioning and stability. Bend your knees so that your feet are flat on the floor, about hip-width apart. Your entire spine should be resting against the floor in a neutral, un-arched position. Keep your back neutral and your shoulders rolled back. Take a few slow, deep breaths to connect with your breathing and focus. 2. Exhale and engage your core. When doing the glute bridge, you want to lift and extend from your hips, not from your spine. Exhale completely, flattening your stomach, and brace your abdominal muscles. As you exhale, keep your spine neutral and tighten your abdominal muscles. 3. Lift your hips toward the ceiling. As you continue to engage your core, drive down into the floor with your heels and flex your glutes to raise your hips off the floor until your hips and thighs are straight in line with each other. In correct position, your body will form a straight, diagonal line from your knees down to your shoulders. You should feel a stretch in your hip flexors on the tops of your thighs. 4. Hold for a second or two. Keep your shoulders rolled back and pinned to the floor. Take care to keep a neutral back – arching your lower back can result in strain or injury. All the work should be coming from your glutes and hamstrings. You only need to hold the glute bridge for a moment before slowly lowering yourself back down to the starting position. Lower your body with control, reversing the same movement you did when you lifted. 5. Do two sets of 10 repetitions. If you're doing the glute bridge on its own, aim for two sets of 10 repetitions two or three times a week. As you build strength in your glutes and hamstrings, you can always add repetitions, or move on to one of the glute bridge variations.",

    "GPT_text": "# Glute Bridge — Text Steps\n\n1. Setup\n\n* Lie on your back with knees bent ~90°, feet flat and hip-width apart. Heels about a hand’s length from your glutes.\n* Arms at ~45° with palms down. Keep neck long and gaze up.\n* Find neutral spine (small natural lower-back curve).\n\n2. Brace\n\n* Inhale through your nose and lightly tighten your abs as if preparing for a gentle poke. Keep ribs down.\n\n3. Drive & Lift\n\n* Exhale and press through your **heels** to lift hips.\n* Squeeze your glutes and slightly tuck your pelvis (think “belt buckle toward ribs”) so you don’t arch your low back.\n* Stop when your shoulders, hips, and knees form a straight line.\n\n4. Hold\n\n* Pause at the top for 1–2 seconds. Knees track over the middle of your feet; don’t let them cave inward. Keep weight on heels/mid-foot.\n\n5. Lower\n\n* Inhale and lower your hips under control until they lightly touch the floor while keeping tension in your glutes.\n\n6. Repeat\n\n* Perform 2–4 sets of 8–15 reps. Rest 45–75 seconds between sets.\n\n### Helpful Cues\n\n* “Crack a walnut” with your glutes at the top.\n* “Push the floor away with your heels.”\n* If you feel it mostly in hamstrings or low back, bring your heels a bit **closer** to your glutes and focus on tucking the pelvis.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n* Overarching the lower back at the top.\n* Pushing through the toes or letting heels lift.\n* Knees collapsing inward.\n* Jutting chin or straining the neck.\n\n### Easy & Hard Options (optional)\n\n* Easier: reduce range, pause just off the floor, or support head with a small pillow.\n* Harder: add a mini-band above knees, hold a weight over hips, single-leg bridge, or slow tempo (3s up/2s hold/3s down).\n\nThe visual guide is included above as a step-by-step image.\n",

Your heels should be a few inches from your glutes. Your arms can be resting by your sides with your palms down.\n**Step 2: Engage Your Core and Glutes**\nBefore lifting, gently brace your core (imagine pulling your belly button towards your spine) and squeeze your glutes. This helps protect your lower back and ensures you're using the right muscles.\n**Step 3: Lift Your Hips**\nPress through your heels and lift your hips off the floor until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Keep squeezing your glutes at the top. Avoid arching your lower back too much.\n**Step 4: Hold and Lower**\nHold the top position for a second or two, really focusing on that glute contraction. Then, slowly lower your hips back down to the starting position with control. Don't just let your hips drop.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Lie on your right side on a yoga mat. You’ll be putting your weight on your feet and your elbow, so you’ll want something soft beneath you. Spread out so you’re lying on your right side on the floor. If you don’t have a yoga mat, try to do this exercise on carpet or a rug so you have a little bit of cushion beneath you. 2. Put your left foot on top of your right foot. Stick your legs straight out so they’re in line with your glutes, then stack your feet on top of each other. This will help you keep your body straight, so it’s super important! Your feet will be anchoring you to the ground, so it’s really important they stay steady throughout this exercise. 3. Push your right elbow underneath your right armpit. Spread your palm out wide to keep your balance. Your arm will be taking most of your weight, so really dig it into the floor to keep your balance. Make sure your right arm stays at a 90-degree angle from your torso the entire time. 4. Engage your core to lift your hips off the ground. To get into the plank position, squeeze your abs and your glutes tight. Lift your hips up off the ground until your body creates a slanted line from your head down to your feet. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your left hand on your hip. Otherwise, keep it flat along your left side. Keep your hips in a straight line with the rest of your body—don't lift them up or let them sink down. [5] X Expert Source Laila Ajani Fitness Trainer Expert Interview 5. Hold the pose for 6 seconds, then lower your hips. When you’re first starting out, this pose might be tough to hold. Try to go for at least 6 seconds, then slowly lower your hips back to the floor. As you get better, you can try holding your side plank for up to 30 seconds at a time. If you’re having trouble, try exhaling as you lift your hips up and inhaling as you lower down. This will help you engage the right muscles so you can hold the pose for longer. 6. Repeat that 3 to 5 times, then switch to your left side. As you practice this more, you’ll be able to do more reps. When you first start out, try to do the pose 3 to 5 times, then roll over onto your left side and repeat. If you don’t feel exhausted by these reps, you can try doing a few more. On the left side, your left arm and left foot will be underneath your body. 7. Bend your knees if you’re a beginner. If you find the normal side plank to be a little too tough, get into a side plank position, but bend your knees to stick your feet out behind you. Engage your glutes to lift your hips off the floor, and use your knees instead of your feet to keep your balance. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source This is a good way to practice the side plank if you’re having trouble keeping your back straight. 8. Do leg raises to engage your obliques. Get into a normal side plank position. Keeping your spine straight, lift your top leg up toward the ceiling, taking it a little bit higher than hip height. Quickly lower your leg back down to complete one repetition. If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, place your outside hand on your hip to keep yourself steady. To really challenge yourself, try holding a dumbbell in your upper hand as you do your leg lifts. Try doing leg lifts 10 to 15 times on each side. 9. Try hip dips to strengthen your lower obliques. Get into a side plank position, then place your left hand on your hip. Slowly lower your hips down toward the floor, stopping just before they touch the ground. Quickly engage your abs to lift your hips back up again for one repetition. You’ll feel this in your abs, your glutes, and your obliques. It’s important to raise back up into a classic side plank position with your spine straight. That way, you won’t lose your posture throughout the exercise. If you’re having trouble with this exercise, do a side plank on your knees and try hip dips that way. Try doing hip dips for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 10. Do a side plank crunch to work on your abs. Get into a side plank position and lift your hips up off the ground. Pull your upper leg and upper arm in towards your torso to do a crunch on that side of your body. Extend your arm and leg outwards to get out of the crunch and complete one repetition. If you feel yourself starting to rock back and forth, engage your glutes to hold yourself steady. Picture this like you’re doing a classic crunch, except now you’re on your side. Start out by doing crunches for 15 to 30 seconds on each side. 11. Work on your balance with an oblique twist. Lie on your side in a side plank position. Lift your hips off the ground, then put your outer hand up by your ear. Slowly turn in toward the floor, stopping yourself when you’re looking directly at your lower forearm. Twist back around to get into your side plank position. These twists engage your entire body, so they’re a great overall workout. Twist 10 to 15 times on each side. 12. Try a side plank slide to challenge yourself. Get into a side plank position. Slowly slide your feet outwards, keeping your spine straight and your weight on your elbow. Tilt your arm so it’s at an angle to work your obliques, then hold the pose for a few seconds. Engage your obliques to slide back upwards into a normal side plank. This move can be a little tough on your elbow, so put a pillow or a foam mat underneath your arm if you need to. Try to keep your spine straight the entire time to get the most out of this workout. Work up to doing slides for 15 to 30 seconds on each side.",

Lead with the inside foot up, drive hips back slightly, then bring the trail foot up. Step down the way you came.\n   * **Easier:** use the lowest step.\n   * **Harder:** pause for 1 second balanced at the top.\n\n4. **Incline Push-Ups — 2 sets of 8–12**\n\n   * Hands on a step (higher step = easier). Body in a straight line, elbows at ~45°. Lower chest toward the step; press back.\n   * **Easier:** move hands to a higher step.\n   * **Harder:** move to a lower step.\n\n5. **Incline Plank Step Taps — 2 sets of 20 alternating taps**\n\n   * Hands on a step in a strong plank. Lift one hand to tap the next higher step, place it back, then switch. Keep hips steady.\n   * **Easier:** widen your stance.\n   * **Harder:** slower tempo or tap two steps up.\n\n6. **Calf Raises — 2 sets of 12–15**\n\n   * Stand on the edge of a step holding the railing lightly. Drop heels slightly below the step, then rise onto the balls of your feet and pause.\n   * **Easier:** both feet.\n   * **Harder:** single-leg.\n\n7. **Toe Taps (Cardio) — 3 rounds of 30–45 sec, 15 sec rest**\n\n   * Rapidly tap the bottom step with alternating feet. Stay light and upright.\n   * **Easier:** slower pace.\n   * **Harder:** pump arms or extend to 60 sec.\n\n8. **Cool-Down (2–3 minutes)**\n\n   * **Calf stretch:** hands on rail, heel down on bottom step, 20–30 sec/side.\n   * **Quad stretch:** stand tall, hold the rail, pull heel to glute, 20–30 sec/side.\n   * **Hamstring stretch:** heel on step, hip hinge with flat back, 20–30 sec/side. Breathe slowly.\n\n# How to structure it\n\n* Do steps **2–7** as a circuit; rest **30–45 sec** between moves.\n* Complete **2–3 circuits** depending on time/fitness.\n\n# Form cues to remember\n\n* Tall chest, ribs down, and brace your core before stepping.\n* Knee tracks roughly over the second/third toe.\n* Move quietly—control down as much as up.\n* Stop if you feel sharp pain or dizziness; consult a pro if you have heart, balance, or joint concerns.\n\nIf you want, tell me your space (number/height of steps and any equipment) and I can tailor reps, progressions, and a weekly plan.\n",

Make sure that the balls of your feet are solidly planted on the edge of the step. Your heels should be over the edge. If you feel unstable, or like you're losing your balance, practice this method with a wall or railing near by. Place your hands on the wall or the railing. 3. Lift your heels until you're standing on your tippy toes. Distribute most of your weight onto the balls of your feet, and keep your legs straight. 4. Stay on your tippy toes for two seconds. Then, begin to lower your heels, and move your weight away from the balls of your feet. Lower your heels until they're below the step, or platform. You should be feeling your calf muscles stretch on the downward movement. Repeat this sequence until you feel tired.",

Choose the right heels\n\n* Pick a stable pair: block heel or wedge, 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm), secure ankle strap, good fit.\n* Add non-slip sole grips if the bottoms are slick.\n\n2. Prep & warm up (1–2 min)\n\n* Ankle circles (both directions), calf raises, gentle hamstring/calf stretch.\n* Check straps/buckles are snug.\n\n3. Posture setup\n\n* Stand tall: ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, ribs stacked, neutral pelvis.\n* Engage your core lightly; look where you’re going (not at your feet).\n\n4. Start with short, quick steps\n\n* Keep strides small to stay balanced.\n* Aim for a light, quick cadence rather than long reaches.\n\n5. Soft forefoot landing\n\n* Touch down gently near the ball of the foot, then roll through—avoid stabbing the heel first.\n* Keep toes pointing forward; don’t let ankles collapse inward.\n\n6. Use compact arm swing\n\n* Elbows ~90°, swing close to the body to counterbalance without twisting your torso.\n\n7. Pick safe surfaces\n\n* Prefer smooth, dry, even ground.\n* Avoid grates, cobblestones, grass, wet tile, and steep slopes.\n* If you must cross hazards, slow to a walk.\n\n8. Braking & turning\n\n* To slow: shorten steps, keep torso tall, don’t lean back.\n* For turns: take several tiny steps (no sharp pivots on a planted heel).\n\n9. Emergency stop & recovery\n\n* If you wobble: plant both feet shoulder-width, knees soft, lower your heels toward flat, then reset.\n* If a heel catches: stop, step back out, don’t yank forward.\n\n10. Cool down & care\n\n* Walk it off for 30–60 seconds, stretch calves/arches.\n* Inspect tips/heel caps; swap to flats if feet feel fatigued.\n\n### Practice Drills (build skill before full running)\n\n* March in place in heels (30–60s).\n* Walk–jog intervals: 10–20m jog, 20–30m walk; repeat 4–6x.\n* Figure-8 weaving around two cones/chairs to train controlled turns.\n\n### Safety Notes\n\n* Running in heels increases risk of ankle/knee injury—only do brief sprints when necessary.\n* Never run in very high, narrow stilettos or loose shoes.\n* Carry foldable flats as a backup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate alternate visuals (e.g., a printable poster or a horizontal storyboard) or tailor the steps to your specific heel height.\n",

    "prompt": "How to perform a deadlift with proper form? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Prepare the barbell. Place the barbell on the ground in front of you and add plates according to your strength and fitness level. If it is your first time performing the deadlift, start lighter. It is always easy to add weight later. You want to perfect your form before you test your physical limits. Secure the plates tightly onto the barbell with clips to keep them from slipping around. Beginners usually start lifting just the barbell, since a typical barbell weighs between 25 and 45 pounds on its own. In this case, you'll want to prop the bar up so it's as high on your shins as it would be if it had plates (approximately 6-8 inches). Otherwise, you'll be bending too far down to pull the barbell right off the floor and could injure yourself. When you prop the barbell, be carefully that it can't easily roll off. 2. Set your stance. Step up to the bar so that your feet are approximately shoulder width apart, your toes are pointing forward or slightly outward, and the barbell is at the midpoint of your foot (as if it's dividing the front and the back of your feet in half). 3. Sit back. Pretend there's a short stool behind you; bend your knees and hips and sit back as if you were going to sit on that stool, while you reach down to grab onto the barbell (hands shoulder-width apart). Actively push your knees out; don't let them collapse in. Keep your back straight so your spine is in a neutral position parallel to the floor. Hinge forward from your hips instead of bending from the waist. [1] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Bend your knees and hips just enough to reach and grab onto the bar. This is the starting position for the deadlift. Your shins should be pretty vertical and touching the bar. This is a hard position to stay in. As you figure out your form and check all these criteria, sometimes you'll straighten your legs and allow your back to curve to take a little break from this position. If you watch people deadlift, you'll see them do this between deadlifts. Just make sure you get back into this position before you actually lift. 4. Check your grip. Grasp the barbell with your hands slightly more than shoulder width apart, just outside of your legs. Keep your arms straight. Your palms should face your body, and be equally far from the ends of the barbell. It's not uncommon for people to use a mixed grip as they move onto heavier weights, as it affords a stronger grip, but it's generally better to keep things simple as a beginner. For Olympic lifting, some people use the hook grip, which is more secure but is painful at first. It is similar to the overhand grip, except that instead of the thumb over the remaining fingers, it is hooked underneath them. The underhand grip alone is not recommended because it can lead to the rupture of bicep muscle and connecting tendons, especially in people who do not have full flexibility in the elbow joint. 5. Set your starting position. \"Setting\" here means creating tension in your body while you're in the starting position so you use your muscles when you pull the bar up. It's a bit like clenching your body; you don't want to be like a wet noodle at all because then you might pull a muscle or hurt a joint. Always make sure your back is completely flat and straight. Keep your head, shoulders, and back in alignment. [2] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview If there is any kind of bend in your back, you need to do some flexibility work before deadlifting. If you have someone record you in starting position, you'll be able to see whether your back is straight or not. Your hips should be above your knees and your shoulders should be above the hips while slightly over the bar. Engage your core and keep your weight heavy in your heels. [3] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Make sure you are looking at the ground in front of you (about 45 degrees) to avoid strain on your neck when performing the lifting portion of the deadlift. 6. Stand up and bring the bar up with you. Raise your hips and shoulders at the same rate while maintaining a flat back. Keep your abs tight during the whole lift. Begin the movement by lifting the slack out of the bar. This is done by pulling the bar slightly up until you feel resistance. If you are using metal plates, you will hear a slight clanging noise. This engages all of the muscles prior to committing to the lift. Next, lift the weight while pushing through the middle of your foot, straightening your knees while pulling your shoulders and head back, and pushing your hips forward after the bar has reached just below the knee. The bar should drag along your shins on the way up--that's why a lot of people who deadlift wear pants or knee-high socks, and if they don't, they often have bruises or scrapes to show for it. Come to a standing position with upright posture and your shoulders pulled back (don't let your shoulders cave forward, think of always pinching your shoulders back together and sticking your chest up and out). Don't bend backwards at all, just stand up straight. Engage (squeeze) your hamstrings and glutes to pull the bar up. Avoid locking your knees. [4] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview 7. Lower the bar. Keeping your back straight, return the bar to the starting position in a controlled manner. Push your butt out as if you are going to sit down in a chair. Do not arch your back or curl your tailbone under. [5] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Release the weight after it is on the ground. 8. Place two dumbbells on either side of your body. The dumbbells should be slightly in front of your feet. Make sure that the weight of your dumbbells is appropriate for your strength. 9. Position yourself properly. Your feet should be spread slightly wider than your shoulders. Point your toes forward. You could also point them slightly outward; the result will be the same. 10. Squat down and grasp the dumbbells. You should squat with a flat, neutral back. Make sure that your shoulders are pulled away from your ears. Keep your head in line with your spine, though if it more comfortable you can tilt your chin up slightly. Make sure that your gaze remains straight ahead (if your eyes wander, so will your head, which will in turn shift your spine.) Make sure that your chest is lifted. Make sure that your heels stay firmly on the floor, and that your shoulders are slightly in front of the balls of your feet. 11. Keep your core strong while you stand up. Your abs help stabilize your spine when you begin to lift the dumbbells. Straighten your knees and then your hips before coming to a fully upright position. Your elbows should be straight and the dumbbells should rest by your sides against your thighs. Your hips and shoulders should rise up and straighten at the same time. You should try to keep the dumbbells as close to your body as possible while you straighten up. 12. Hinge at the knees to lower the dumbbells back down. Your hips should move backwards and down as you begin to squat back down to the ground. Try to avoid bending your knees so that they are far ahead of your toes. Keep your back straight and avoid curling your tailbone in or arching your back. Make sure to keep your abs strong and engaged while you lower back down. Keep your shoulders back and lowered while you do this lift and squat.",

    "text_ref": "1. Stand on the middle section of a resistance band. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview Hold the ends of your resistance band so the middle section is on the floor. Step onto the band with one of your feet so the band is in the center of your foot. Then place your other foot on the resistance band so your feet are shoulder-width apart. Make sure the band doesn’t move around and that your feet are comfortable. You can buy resistance bands from any fitness store or online. If you want an easier workout, only step on the resistance band with one foot instead. 2. Hold the ends of the resistance band in your hands. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview Stand with your back straight and look forward while you perform your exercise. Keep your arms straight down with your palms at your side so they face inward. Hold the band so there’s a small amount of tension between your hands and your feet. Some resistance bands have handles so you can easily hold onto them. Otherwise, grab and hold them as tight as you can. 3. Bend your elbows and hold your curl for 2-3 counts. Raise your hands to stretch the ends of the resistance band and pull them tight. Use a slow, controlled motion so the bands don’t snap or slip. Bring your hands in front of your shoulders and flex your biceps for 1-2 seconds to work your muscles. If you want to make your curl more challenging, hold dumbbells as well as the resistance band. You can choose to raise both your arms at once or alternate arms with each curl. 4. Lower your arms slowly to complete your rep. After your count, straighten out your arms again at the same controlled speed. Don’t let go of the bands when you bring your arms down, or else you could hurt yourself. Once your hands are at your side and the resistance band feels loose again, rest for 1 count before continuing your reps. Complete 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps during your workout sessions. Don’t lift your feet at any point during your curl since the resistance band could snap up and hurt you. 5. Put a resistance band under your feet while you’re sitting in a chair. Use a chair or bench that doesn’t have any sides when you do your curls. Slide the center of your resistance band underneath your feet so they’re shoulder-width apart. Once the resistance band is secure under your feet, sit up so your back is straight and you’re looking forward. Make sure the chair or bench you’re using doesn’t move around too much or else the resistance band could slip from underneath your feet. 6. Hold the ends of the resistance band so your palms face inward. Keep your arms at your side so they hang down past the seat. Get a tight grip on the ends of the resistance band so it has a small amount of tension while you’re relaxed. Make sure your palms face inward so you can perform your curls easily. Check if your resistance band has attachable handles to make holding onto it easier. 7. Curl your arms toward your chest to stretch the resistance band. Avoid moving your back, shoulders, and elbows while you perform your curl. Stretch the resistance band by bringing your hands up toward your chest and keep your wrists straight so your hands line up with your forearms. Once you reach the top of your curl, hold it for 1-2 seconds. Use dumbbells as well as your resistance band to make your workouts more challenging. Use lighter weights since the resistance band will already make it difficult to lift. Lift both arms at the same time or alternate arms with each curl. 8. Lower your arms until they’re straight after 1-2 counts. Slowly lower your arms until they’re straight and the resistance bands are relaxed. Don’t let the band pull your arms down quickly because it won’t make your workout as beneficial. At the end of your rep, take a brief pause before continuing your set. Perform 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps. If you want more resistance, space your feet wider apart and choke up on the ends of the bands. 9. Step on the center of the resistance band with one of your feet. Choose one of your feet to start with and stand on the middle of the band with it. Position the band so it’s underneath your toes rather than in the center of your foot. Hold the ends of the resistance band with both hands so it has a small amount of resistance when your arms are straight. It doesn’t matter which foot you start with since you’ll switch them later on. You can choose to curl both arms at the same time or only curl the arm that’s opposite of the leg you’re stepping forward with. 10. Take a large step forward with your other foot. Step forward with your other foot so it’s about 2–3 feet (61–91 cm) in front of the resistance band. Make sure your feet point forward so you can maintain your form. Keep your knees slightly bent and your back straight so you’re looking forward. Stepping forward adds tension to the resistance band. If it feels too tight or difficult to pull, loosen your grip on the end or use a lower resistance. Don’t step too far forward where you’ll easily lose your balance since the resistance band could snap back toward you if you fall. 11. Bend your knees so they form 90-degree angles. Lower your body closer to the ground by bending your knees. Keep your back straight as you get closer to the ground to work out your legs and hips. When your knee in front forms a 90-degree angle, keep holding the position for 1-2 seconds. Don’t lift your feet off the ground while you’re lunging since the resistance could slip from underneath your foot. 12. Curl your arms toward your shoulder while maintaining the lunge position. As you lower your body into the lunge position, bend your elbows to bring your hands closer to your shoulders. Keep your palms facing inward and your wrists straight to make stretching the resistance band slightly easier. Once your biceps are flexed, hold the lunge position and curl for about 1 second. Then lower your arms slowly to finish the curl. You can use dumbbells if you want to add more weight to your routine. After 10-15 reps, switch which leg is in back so you get an even workout. Perform 10-15 reps for each leg for 2-3 sets.",

    "GPT_text": "# Text Steps — Resistance Band Bicep Curl\n\n1. Setup\n\n* Stand hip-width with the middle of a loop band under both feet.\n* Hold the ends/handles with palms facing forward.\n* Soften your knees, brace your core, chest tall, shoulders down/back.\n\n2. Start Position\n\n* Arms straight but not locked; elbows tucked to your sides.\n* Wrists neutral (don’t bend them). Exhale gently to brace.\n\n3. Curl Up\n\n* Without swinging your torso, bend your elbows and pull your hands toward your shoulders.\n* Keep elbows pinned to your ribs; only the forearms move.\n* Think “drive pinkies up” to keep palms supinated.\n\n4. Squeeze\n\n* At the top (forearms roughly vertical), pause 1 second and squeeze the biceps.\n\n5. Lower Slowly\n\n* Inhale as you lower the handles back down over 2–3 seconds, fully straightening the elbows without locking them.\n\n6. Repeat\n\n* Do 8–15 controlled reps. Rest 45–75 seconds. Complete 2–4 sets.\n\n---\n\n## Form Cues\n\n* Neutral spine; avoid leaning back.\n* Keep ribs down and glutes lightly engaged.\n* Wrists stay straight; don’t “curl” with the wrists.\n* Elbows stay close—don’t let them drift forward/out.\n\n## Make It Easier/Harder\n\n* Easier: Use a lighter band, narrow your stance, or perform one arm at a time.\n* Harder: Use a heavier band, widen your stance to shorten the band, or slow the lowering to 3–4 seconds.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n* Rocking the torso to create momentum.\n* Letting elbows flare away from the body.\n* Letting the band snap you down—control the entire range.\n\n## Variations\n\n* **Hammer Curl (neutral grip):** Palms face each other—hits brachialis/forearms more.\n* **Alternating Curl:** Curl one arm at a time to focus on mind-muscle connection.\n* **Staggered Stance:** Helps balance and reduces back arch.\n* **Low Anchor Curl:** Anchor the band low behind you to mimic an “incline curl” angle.\n\nIf anything hurts (sharp joint pain), stop and reassess form or choose a lighter band.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Work on a traditional toe-touch. Sit on a mat with your legs straight together in front of you. Bend forward and reach your hands toward your feet. When you touch your feet, gently hold them for 30 seconds. Then slowly roll your upper body back into the upright position. Repeat for as many reps as you like. If you cannot reach your feet, hold your hands out as far as you can go. If you want more of a challenge, flex your feet outwards and try to touch your toes. Try to make your body as flat as possible. Do not force yourself to do it for too long. Just do your best. 2. Do a single-leg toe-touch. Sit upright on a mat with both legs in front of you. Bend 1 leg so that the flat part of that foot is tucked into your groin. Then reach your hands toward the leg and foot that are still straight out in front of you. Once you touch your foot, hold this position for 30 seconds. Switch legs and repeat. The knee of your bent leg will likely push toward the ground as you lean forward. 3. Hold a butterfly pose. Sit on a mat with your legs bent to the sides and soles of your feet together. Slowly move your heels toward your core. Let your knees fall closer to the mat as you move. Bend forward towards your ankles in a controlled way. Hold this pose until you feel a stretch in your hips and thighs. 4. Lean into a pancake fold stretch. Sit upright on a mat with your legs spread out in front of you. They should be as far apart as comfortable. Then, slowly slide your hands in front of you on the ground away from your body. Fold your upper torso forward towards the ground, following your hands. Stop folding when you feel tension in your hips, thighs, or back. Hold for 30 seconds before sliding back upwards. Repeat. For more of a challenge, reach out to grasp your ankles as you slide your torso downwards. At some point, you will even be able to rest your face on the ground mid-stretch. 5. Do a series of half-squats. Stand up straight with your legs slightly wider than shoulder-width. Lean forward until you can touch the ground. Stretch your left leg straight out to the side. At the same time, bend your right knee into a partial squat. Start by doing 5 reps of this move on each leg. You can always build up to more reps as you develop. 6. Perform a frog stretch. Get down on all fours on an exercise mat. Slide your knees apart while keeping your toes pointed back. Slowly move your hands forward on the mat. Your torso will start to lower towards the mat. In a controlled way, let your hips shift towards the mat, while your thighs will continue to open outwards. Hold this position for 30 seconds before regaining your starting position. Depending on your level of flexibility, your hips may not open all the way. It’s okay to prop yourself up on your forearms or hands. You can even continue this move until you are completely lying down and then repeat. 7. Complete a wall straddle. Position yourself with your hips pushed against a wall and your legs stretched out vertically on the wall. Slowly slide your legs along the wall to separate them, moving into a straddle position. Your heels should stay touching the wall the entire time. Stop and hold the position for 1 minute when you start to feel tension in your hip muscles. Return your legs to their starting position and repeat. If you want a more challenging stretch, press your hands against your thighs as you move your legs outwards. 8. Hold a half-lunge. [3] X Expert Source Greg Maurer Health & Fitness Specialist Expert Interview Position yourself in a kneeling position with both knees on the ground with your legs flat on the mat behind you. Move one of your legs forward in front of you with the knee in a right angle position. Place your hands on your hips, keeping your torso in a vertical position. Then, slowly lean your hips forward. When you feel tension in your muscles, hold this position for 30 seconds. Return the leg to its prior position and repeat with the other leg. If your form is good, you should feel a stretch in the front of your thighs and your groin area. If you feel the stretch somewhere else, you may not have the right form. At least 1 of your calves should be behind you and lying flat on the mat throughout the exercise. 9. Warm up for 5-10 minutes before stretching. [5] X Expert Source Greg Maurer Health & Fitness Specialist Expert Interview Complete a series of jumping jacks. Do a light jog for around 5 minutes. Try jumping rope slowly for the warm-up period. The goal is to get the blood flowing to your muscles, so that you’ll avoid an injury when stretching. 10. Hold each pose just to the point of tension. Bouncing in and out of a stretching pose can lead to muscle and joint damage. Instead, slowly ease yourself in and out of each position. Continue to hold your stretch until you feel a slight burning in your muscles. This sensation usually develops after 30 seconds or more of a stretch. Exactly how long you hold a stretch will really depend on your body and fitness level. Some people will get a benefit from a 30-second stretch, whereas others will need to hold the same position for a minute. 11. Stop immediately if you feel any pain. You might feel some muscle soreness as you move into each stretching position. This is normal and to be expected with a regular stretching routine. However, if you feel a deep, sharp, or stabbing pain, then pull out of your stretching position right away. Continuing to stretch with intense pain can cause joint damage. Stretching pain is most likely to come from your joints, such as your knees or hips. 12. Practice stretching every other day. While it is really tempting to stretch every day, you can easily overdo it and overwork your muscles. Instead, give your muscles and joints adequate recovery time by setting aside a period every other day devoted to stretching and preparation for the splits. A 30-minute stretching work-out, including warm-up, is usually adequate.",

Remember to warm up before stretching and listen to your body – never force a stretch.\n\n**Step 1: Warm-up (Light Cardio)**\nBefore you start any deep stretching, it's crucial to warm up your muscles. This could be 5-10 minutes of light cardio like jogging in place, jumping jacks, or brisk walking.\n\n**Step 2: Forward Fold**\nStand with your feet hip-width apart. Hinge at your hips and slowly lower your torso towards your legs, keeping your back as straight as possible. You can bend your knees slightly if needed. Hold for 30 seconds.\n**Step 3: Lunges**\nStep one foot forward, keeping your back leg straight and your heel lifted. Lower your hips until your front knee is bent at a 90-degree angle and directly over your ankle. Keep your core engaged. Hold for 30 seconds on each side.\n**Step 4: Low Lunge / Runner's Lunge**\nFrom a lunge position, lower your back knee to the ground. You can keep your hands on the floor inside your front foot, or even lower onto your forearms for a deeper stretch in your hips and hamstrings. Hold for 30 seconds on each side.\n",

    "prompt": "How to perform high knees exercise? Use visual steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Keep your arms at your sides, feet hip-width apart. Stand tall with your thighs perpendicular to the ground as you begin this motion, making sure not to move them higher than this parallel point. Avoid kicking your legs backward while doing this. 2. Slowly lift one knee at a time. Alternate between each of your knees one at a time, lifting and lowering your legs at the same steady speed. Lift your left knee as high as you can and then lower at the same speed, letting your foot touch the ground right before lifting your right knee up to repeat this same process. Take off and land on the balls of your feet. If you're using good form, your feet will be lined up directly below your knees. Your feet should not be extended out or bent back. High knees consist of lifting your knees as high up as possible, your left and right knees raising and lowering in an alternating fashion. 3. Begin swinging your arms while maintaining a slow march. Swing your arms from your shoulders front and back while avoiding side-to-side swaying. You should synchronize this movement with the opposite leg. Keep your elbows bent, with hands passing your body near the hips. 4. Pick up your pace, lifting your knees quickly while maintaining good form. Keep your eyes focused straight ahead while keeping your back straight to sustain stable posture. Your legs should still be lifting and lowering in an alternating fashion. As your pace quickens with your gained confidence, your hands should rise up level to your cheeks with each knee up. 5. Do double high knees only when you're ready. You can perform double high knees by jumping, bringing both knees up towards your waist. You can hold your hands at your waist, slapping your knees against them when you jump, or you can swing your arms. You should only progress to this stage if you have healthy knees and ankles. At first, you may want to jump just a few inches off the ground, working your way up to double high knees. If you're an advanced athlete, you can mix double high knees with other high-intensity intervals for a more complete workout. 6. Begin by performing stationary high knees. Do a couple repetitions of this to get comfortable with the motion and formation prior to beginning any forward movement. Start by lifting your left leg as high as you can and then lower at the same speed before lifting your right leg and doing the same. You should be taking off and landing on the balls of your feet. While doing high knees, be sure your back is straight, arms are swaying, and eyes are focused straight ahead. Lift your left and rights knees as high as possible in an alternating fashion for the duration of your high knee exercise. Knees should be raised and lowered at the same speed, starting off slowly and gaining speed as your comfort in performing the exercise increases. 7. Step forward slowly to start moving at a walking pace. Once you have mastered doing the standard stationary high knee, you can begin moving forward. During each knee high, lower your leg a few inches away from its original take off point. Pay attention to lifting your knees up and bringing them down rapidly, rather than physically moving forward at a swift speed. Slow your movements down if your form begins to suffer. 8. Pick up your speed while moving in a straight line. Gradually pick up the pace of your high knees while you move forward, as you get comfortable with the motion. Keep your arms following the natural movement that they would if you were running. Focus on achieving a high turnover of performing many high knees rather than racing down the hallway. Be patient and focus your attention on single areas of improvement at a given time, rather than many all at once. 9. Select a jump rope that is the appropriate length. To do this, hold onto each of the rope's handles and step on the center of it with your feet pressed together side-by-side. The rope is the correct length for your height if it can be comfortably lifted by the handles up to your armpits. It should not exceed this length. 10. Get into position to begin high knees while jumping rope. Ensure that you can safely begin performing the exercise and that you are not in a position that will cause you physical harm once the workout begins. Take the rope handles in each of your hands and place your feet in front of the jump rope, hip-width apart. Allow the rope to rest on the ground behind your heels. Let your arms hang while tucking your elbows into your sides. Bring your hands up so that your forearms rest parallel to the ground, with your feet a couple inches apart. This will be your starting position. 11. Be prepared to jump in proper high knee form. Alternate between each of your knees one at a time, lifting and lowering your legs at the same steady speed. Take off and land on the balls of your feet. When doing high knees with a jump rope, lift both knees as high as possible, simultaneously. If you're just getting started, it's okay to start small and work your way up to high knees. At first, jump just a few inches off the ground. As you get better at jumping rope, jump higher, bringing your knees up. When you're ready, start doing high knees. Since this exercise is very intense, you should only do it 2 to 3 times per week. 12. Swing the rope over your head and jump off the ground with both feet. Repeat this motion for the duration of your high knee workout. As the rope begins to reach your feet, jump over it while raising both knees as high as possible. Only flick your wrists and forearms when bringing the jump rope around, as opposed to swinging with the force of your entire arm. Always start out the exercise slow and build up into a faster rhythm as you work into it. Your knees should be rising and lowering at the same speed, consistently increasing in speed as you gain confidence in the workout. Repeat these motions until the necessary time has elapsed, or total number of repetitions have been completed, as outlined by your workout regime. 13. Perform a variation of the exercise to switch things up. Do the exercise with only one leg at a time. Switch from your left to right foot after the completion of each repetition, alternating between the two. This would consist of lifting each knee as high as possible, left to right, an alternating fashion. You can also alternate from the left to right foot with each jump, within the same set.",

    "text_ref": "1. Aim for 10 to 30 seconds at a time. When you first start out, you might only be able to hold a plank for 5 to 10 seconds, and that’s okay! As you get stronger and your body gets used to the position, try holding it for longer and longer. [1] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source 2. Hold a plank for 2 minutes maximum. Experts note that after 2 minutes, you’ve reached the maximum benefits that the plank can give you. If you can hold it for 2 minutes straight without wavering, you’re building muscles and burning calories to reach your fitness goals. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you want to test your core strength, lie on a Bosu Ball with your tailbone in the middle of it. Hold the entire body suspended on the Bosu Ball parallel to the ground. If you cannot hold this position for at least 10 seconds, the core needs some work! [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 3. Balance on your forearms and your toes with your body off the ground. Start by lying on your stomach with your forearms underneath you. Keep your elbows directly underneath your shoulders with your palms down. Engage your abs and your torso to rise up onto your toes, keeping your hips and stomach off the ground. Squeeze your legs and your glutes to keep your body in a straight line. Holding the plank only works if you’re in the right formation. If you have to sway your back or raise your rear end to hold the plank, it’s time to drop down and take a rest. 4. Try doing 1 to 6 reps every day. When you first start out, you may only be able to hold one plank a day, which is fine! As you build strength, you can work your way up to 2 planks, then 3, and so on. [5] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you can’t do all 6 planks in a row, that’s totally fine. It might be easier to space them out throughout the day. 5. Yes, especially for a beginner! Half a minute is a great amount of time to hold a plank, especially if you’ve never done it before. If you can’t reach 30 seconds right away, don’t sweat it—just keep trying until you can. [6] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source 6. You’ll strengthen your core. Planks are a great full body workout that target your abs and your core muscles. If you do planks every day, you’ll probably notice that your core muscles are stronger, which is great for balancing and holding your form during other exercises. [7] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source 7. You’ll also strengthen your legs. In the plank, your glutes, quads, and hamstrings are also getting a workout. Squeeze your legs tightly in the plank position to get the full effect of this exercise. 8. Yes, the plank gets easier the more often you do it. When you first start out, you might feel shaky or weak as you hold the position. Keep squeezing your legs and your abs, and try to hold a plank for longer periods every time you do it. [9] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source If you’re struggling to hold the plank position, keep your arms in place but drop down to your knees. You’ll still work your abs and your core, but your legs won’t have to work quite as hard. 9. Planks are mostly a strength-building exercise. Since you’re holding a static position and flexing your muscles the entire time, you’re working on building muscular strength. If you’d like to add some cardio to your plank exercises, try modifying them with hip touches or up and down planks. [11] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Hip touches: Start in a standard plank with your body in a straight line. Slowly rotate your right hip down to the floor, raising your left hip in the air. Keep your body in a straight line as you gently touch your right hip on the ground. Then, rotate your left hip to the left side. Up and downs: Start in a standard plank position with your forearms on the floor. Press up with your right hand so you’re balancing with your right palm flat on the floor. Then, press up with your left hand so you have both palms flat on the floor. Quickly lower back down to your right forearm, then your left forearm. Keep your abs engaged and your body in a straight line the entire time.",

On the exhale, **brace your core** like you’re about to be lightly poked in the stomach.\n* Squeeze glutes and lightly **tuck the pelvis** (posterior tilt) to keep the low back neutral.\n* Press the floor away so your shoulder blades spread slightly (no shoulder shrug).\n\n3. Step back to plank\n\n* Extend one leg back, then the other so you’re on your toes.\n* Feet hip-width apart (wider is easier for balance).\n\n4. Find your straight line\n\n* Ears-to-ankles in one line: **neck long, gaze down**, ribs stacked over pelvis, hips neither sagging nor piked.\n* Keep quads tight and heels pushing back.\n\n5. Breathe & hold\n\n* Breathe quietly—**3–4 second inhale, 3–5 second exhale**.\n* Hold for **10–30 seconds** with perfect form. Rest, then do 2–4 sets. (Advance toward 30–60 seconds if pain-free and form is solid.)\n\n6. Finish\n\n* Gently **lower your knees** to the mat, then sit back and relax the shoulders.\n\n### Quick checkpoints\n\n* Elbows under shoulders\n* Ribs down, pelvis slightly tucked\n* Hips level with shoulders\n* Head in line with spine\n* Steady breathing\n\n### Common mistakes (avoid)\n\n* Sagging or hiking the hips\n* Letting the low back arch or the head drop\n* Shrugging into the neck or collapsing through the shoulders\n* Holding your breath\n\n### Easier options\n\n* **Knee plank** (knees on the mat, same alignment)\n* **Hands elevated** on a bench or countertop (high plank)\n\n### Harder options (when ready)\n\n* **High plank** on hands\n* **Side plank** (stack feet, elbow under shoulder)\n* **Single-leg or shoulder tap** holds while keeping hips still\n\nIf anything hurts—especially your lower back—stop, reset your alignment, or choose an easier option.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Swing a Baseball Bat? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Line your legs and feet up beneath your shoulders. Place your feet shoulder width apart or slightly wider. Your feet should be parallel to one another and aligned directly under your shoulders. If you’re right handed, your left side should be facing the pitcher, with your head pointed in the direction the ball will be coming from. If you’re left handed, it will be your right side. Above all, your stance should be comfortable. Resting on the balls of your feet will make your movements quicker and your stance more reactive. 2. Keep your knees bent. Bend your knees and sink into the balls of your feet. Don’t crouch or stoop too low—make sure there is a little spring in your knees and hips. A lower center of gravity will help you generate force in your swing and stabilize you while you’re batting. It’s important to adopt a steady, grounded stance to keep from compromising your balance. Don’t stick out your butt or let your upper body lean too far. 3. Plant your back foot. Keep both feet firmly rooted on the ground until you’re ready to start your swing. The more steady your stance, the more power you’ll be able to produce by driving from the feet up. As you begin the swing, you will take a small step with your front foot and twist the back foot to follow through, but up until you make contact with the ball, both feet should be locked in place. Your weight should be positioned very slightly over your rear foot to prepare you to step into your swing later on. 4. Stay loose and ready. Relax your muscles and prepare to move your body in one fluid motion. If you’re tense, your movements will be erratic and your speed and precision will suffer. Shake out your shoulders, hips and ankles before stepping up to bat. Remind yourself to remain loose and poised rather than bunching up. Sports research has found that athletes move much faster and more smoothly when they are relaxed. 5. Get your hands in the right position. To get an effective grip, lay the handle of the bat across the fingers of both hands, then wrap your hands around the bat. Don’t hold the bat in the palms, as this doesn’t allow you to flex and rotate your wrists as well when you swing. Keep a light grip on the bat until the moment you make contact with the ball to maximize your speed and reactivity. Don’t grip too high on the handle of the bat; this can blunt your swing. There should be very little space between the pinky finger of your bottom hand and the bottom knob. Always think of gripping the bat with the fingers, not the whole hand. 6. Line up your knuckles. Keep the tops of your fingers in one long row down the grip of the bat. The bat will shift in your hands as you swing, and both hands will naturally turn on the handle. Use the pressure of your fingers to steady the bat, but don’t grip it too tightly. If it isn’t comfortable to hold the bat with the tops of your knuckles aligned, try turning your hands inward until your middle knuckles point in the same direction. This is known as a “box grip.” 7. Let the bat hover over your shoulder. Let the bat point upwards at an angle over your shoulder rather than resting it flat across your back. Keep the bat raised off your shoulder, ready to begin the swing. At no point should any part of the bat touch your back, neck or shoulder. The angle at which you hold the bat should be around or just over 45 degrees. It’s easier to enter into the swing quickly if there’s already some muscular tension on the bat. Your swing will be much more sluggish if you’re trying to move the bat from a dead stop. 8. Keep your body in a straight line. Situate your center of gravity over your feet and keep your toes, knees, hips and shoulders aligned. Point your chin toward the mound to have an eye on the ball at all times. From this position, you will explode and uncoil once the ball is within hitting distance. If any part of your body deviates from your linear stance, you will sacrifice speed, power and control. 9. Take a small step to increase your power. Once the ball leaves the pitcher’s hand, step out very slightly with the front foot. Only move the foot 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm), and be careful not to come out of alignment or lose tightness in your core as you step. This will increase the power of your swing by adding directional force to the motion of the hips and shoulders. Be careful not to throw off your balance as you step. The step should be quick, short and leave you in a position with a solid base to hit the ball. 10. Initiate the swing with your hips. With one quick motion, rotate the hips to create momentum for the swing. Don’t let the hips sway or move out of alignment with the rest of your body as you swivel. If you’re right handed, you should turn your hips counterclockwise, and clockwise for left handed batters. Most of the power of a good swing originates at the hips. The swing should begin with the hips, with the shoulders following closely behind. A lot of injuries occur when players try to “muscle” the ball with a wrenching motion of the shoulders. Try to stay upright as you rotate so you don’t come off your axis. 11. Keep your eyes on the ball. Drop your chin and keep your head held low throughout your swing. Your line of sight should be locked onto the ball at all times, from the beginning of the pitch to the moment that either the bat touches the ball or you strike out. Stay focused and get ready to time your swing. Lowering your chin will help keep your head in alignment with the rest of your body, as you will be hunched over and bent at the waist slightly while preparing to bat. Don't tilt your head too much when dropping your chin. If your eyes are not level, it may throw off your perspective and compromise your ability to zero in on the ball. During batting practice, pay close attention to the path that the ball takes to get better at tracking it as it moves toward you. 12. Turn your shoulders into the swing. Bring your shoulders across your body, following the hips. Remain relaxed until just before the bat strikes the ball. The entire body should uncoil like a spring, from the feet up through the hips, ending with the turn of the shoulders. The shaft of the bat should stay in tight during the first part of the swing. As a rule, the further the tip of the bat is from the body, the less leverage you have. 13. Follow through to drive it home. After you’ve struck the ball, continue driving through the swing until the bat is extended over your opposite shoulder. At the end of your rotation your upper body should be facing the pitcher. A good follow through will put extra heat on the ball to smash it out of the park. Following through makes the most of the momentum of rotation, stopping the forward movement of the ball and sending it back with as much power as possible. Some players prefer to keep both hands on the bat as they follow through, while others release their top hand and let the bat continue swinging like a backhand. Try out both methods, but do whatever feels most comfortable to you.",

Finish\n\n* Full hip and shoulder rotation with a balanced, high finish.\n* Back foot on the toe; chest stays over the plate, eyes at contact point.\n\nQuick cues: “Slow to, fast through.” • “Head quiet.” • “Short stride.” • “Hips lead, hands deliver.”\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid\n\n* Over-striding or opening the front shoulder early.\n* Casting the barrel (long, loopy swing).\n* Lunging forward instead of rotating around a firm front side.\n* Gripping too tight and losing bat speed.\n\nSimple practice drills\n\n* Dry swings in front of a mirror: check posture, stride length, and finish.\n* Tee work: aim for line drives to the middle; keep head down at contact.\n* Soft toss/front toss: focus on staying inside the ball and balanced finish.\n\nTip for left-handed hitters: Mirror these steps (opposite legs/hands).\n",

    "prompt": "How to Do Bicep Curls? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Start small and work your way up the dumbbell scale as you progress. If you are new to doing curls, or simply looking to maintain existing muscle tone, even 1 to 3 lb (0.45 to 1.36 kg) weights may be sufficient. Taking on too much weight causes a breakdown in technique and can easily lead to injuries of the elbow, wrist, or muscle tissue. If you are going to do 2-handed curls with a bar, the same principle holds. Start at a lower weight and work your way up slowly. Everyone is different, so start with lighter weights and find the maximum amount that permits you to do your desired number of repetitions (reps) while retaining the proper form. 2. Adjust your regime to suit your goal. Generally speaking, if you are seeking to maintain existing muscle tone and arm strength, it is better to do more reps per set with a lower dumbbell weight. If you are looking to build muscle, do fewer reps at a higher weight (but again, don’t sacrifice technique). For muscle maintenance, do 1 to 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps each, for each arm. For strength building, sets of 6 to 8 reps may be preferable. Let your body be your guide. If you can’t do the number of reps you seek, reduce the dumbbell weight. If necessary, start with 1 set per arm and build up to 3. Reader Poll: We asked 649 wikiHow readers what type of exercise they enjoy most for arm workouts, and 72% of them said weightlifting. 3. Isolate your body movement so that only the arm doing the curl is moving. Traditional biceps curls are done while standing, but can also be done easily and properly while seated. Creating a solid base with your body positioning is critical to achieving this goal. Stand with your feet at hip width and your knees slightly bent. Keep your back straight and your abdomen pulled in (but not uncomfortably so). Let your arms rest at your sides and look forward—into a mirror, if possible, to monitor your technique. Sit with your feet firmly on the ground, your back straight and abdomen in, your arms to the side, and your head looking forward. Make sure the chair or bench will not impede your arm motion (or the dumbbell’s) during the curls. 4. Keep it smooth and simple. In spite of the form displayed by the aspiring Mr. Universe you might run into at the gym, a bicep curl shouldn’t be a quick, jerking motion that involves the entire body. It is meant to be a slow, steady, consistent motion that isolates a single muscle group. You can do dumbbell curls with both arms at the same time (or alternating arms), but for simplicity’s sake (especially as a beginner), you should probably start with 1 arm at a time. Or, you can do curls with both arms at the same time by using a bar. If so, you will use the same arm motions as described below for a dumbbell. With the dumbbell securely in your hand, palm facing forward and arm loose to your side, exhale and slowly bend your elbow and contract your biceps to draw the weight upward. While lifting, try to keep every other part of your body still. Keep raising the weight until it is at shoulder height, or even touching your shoulder. Pause for a beat without stopping to let the weight rest on your shoulder. Inhale and slowly lower the weight back to the starting position. Don’t let it just drop back down — control the movement in each direction. 5. Don’t cheat yourself. Sacrificing form to lift bigger dumbbells not only risks injury, it also minimizes the benefits of the curls. “Maxing out” on a curl should mean getting the most out of each one, not hurting yourself by flailing around with a giant dumbbell. Keep your wrists straight and rigid throughout the entire curl. It is easy to cause injury by using your wrist as a lever or letting it swing loosely. Use wrist wraps if they help. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Don’t lean forward to start the curl, and/or rock backward during the lift. Your body should not be acting as a pendulum during the curl — this takes the focus away from your biceps, and can cause a loss of balance and possible injury. Don’t let the weight rest on your shoulder at the top of the motion. If you need a break during a set, you are using too much weight or doing too many reps. Likewise, don’t rest your elbows on your hips or the sides of your abdomen during the motion. You want the full weight of the dumbbells to be isolated on your biceps. 6. Return and repeat. When you finish a curl, make sure you extend your arm fully — leaving your elbow slightly bent is another cheat that will reduce the impact of each curl. Once you’ve returned the dumbbell to the proper starting position, pause just long enough to refocus and exhale as you begin the next lift. Rest for 30 to 90 seconds between sets, if you are doing more than 1. If you're curling 1 arm at a time, keep alternating arms while allowing 1 to rest between its sets. Again, it is better to reduce the weight, or your reps or sets, than to let your form break down.",

Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.\n* Shoulders back and down, ribs stacked over hips, eyes forward.\n* Grip lightly, wrists straight (knuckles facing out), elbows close to your ribs.\n\n2. Brace\n\n* Inhale, engage your core and glutes. Keep a neutral spine—no leaning.\n\n3. Curl\n\n* Exhale as you bend the elbows and lift the weights toward your shoulders.\n* Keep elbows pinned to your sides; don’t let them drift forward.\n* As you lift, rotate forearms so palms face up by the top (supination).\n\n4. Squeeze\n\n* Pause briefly at the top. Feel the biceps working.\n* Don’t shrug or let wrists bend; forearms stay in line with the back of your hands.\n\n5. Lower\n\n* Inhale as you lower slowly for 2–3 seconds.\n* Fully straighten the elbows without locking; keep shoulders relaxed.\n\n6. Repeat\n\n* Perform 8–12 controlled reps for 2–4 sets. Rest 60–90 seconds between sets.\n* Choose a weight that leaves 1–2 reps “in the tank” at the end of each set.\n\n## Quick cues\n\n* Tempo: **2–0–2** (two seconds up, no pause, two seconds down).\n* Range: Full elbow extension to full elbow flexion without swinging.\n* Breath: Exhale up, inhale down.\n\n## Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Swinging your torso or using momentum.\n* Elbows flaring away from your sides.\n* Bending or curling your wrists.\n* Cutting the range short or rushing the lowering phase.\n\n## Variations (optional)\n\n* **Hammer Curl:** Neutral grip the whole time; targets brachialis/forearm more.\n* **Barbell Curl:** Two hands on a bar; keep elbows tucked.\n* **Incline Dumbbell Curl:** On an incline bench; emphasizes the long head stretch.\n* **Concentration Curl:** Seated, elbow braced on inner thigh for strict form.\n\nWant a second visual for hammer curls or barbell curls too?\n",

Keep gaze forward.\n\n3. **Press Up**\n\n* Drive the dumbbells **up and slightly back**, letting your head move a touch back so the bells travel close to your face.\n* Keep ribs from flaring; maintain tight glutes and abs.\n* Elbows stay under (or just in front of) the wrists—don’t let them flare wide.\n\n4. **Lockout**\n\n* Finish with arms straight, **biceps near ears**, shoulders down (no shrug).\n* Exhale at the top or through the sticking point. Pause briefly under control.\n\n5. **Lower**\n\n* Pull the weights back to shoulders on a controlled 2–3-second descent.\n* Keep torso tall; don’t lean back or arch.\n\n6. **Breathe & Repeat**\n\n* Reset your brace each rep. Perform 6–12 reps for hypertrophy or 3–6 for strength.\n* Stop 1–2 reps shy of form breakdown.\n\n---\n\n### Quick Tips\n\n* Start lighter than you think; build up in 2–5 lb jumps.\n* If your low back arches, **tighten abs and glutes** or switch to a half-kneeling stance.\n* Think “press the body **under** the bells” rather than pushing them far forward.\n\n### Common Mistakes → Fixes\n\n* **Flaring ribs / big back arch** → Squeeze glutes, exhale, knit ribs down.\n* **Bent-back wrists** → Stack knuckles over forearms; grip the handles firmly.\n* **Press path in front** → Aim slightly back at the top so bells finish over mid-foot.\n* **Shrugging** → Keep shoulder blades set down; don’t chase height with traps.\n\n### Variations\n\n* **Seated press** for more stability.\n* **Arnold press** for extra front-delt/rotation work.\n* **Single-arm press** to train anti-lean core control.\n\nStay smooth and pain-free—if you feel shoulder pinching, reduce range, rotate palms in, or stop.",

    "prompt": "How to Build Powerful Glutes Using a Hip Thrust Machine? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Load plates onto the machine’s bars. If the hip thrust machine you’re using doesn’t have attached weights, you’ll need to use free weights like the ones you’d put on a barbell. Find 2 plates that are the same weight to keep the machine balanced. Slide one of your weights onto the metal bar that looks like the end of a barbell found on the side of the machine. Then load the second weight onto the other bar on the opposite side of the machine. Only use as much weight as you’re comfortable lifting so you don’t overexert yourself. You can add more plates to each bar if you want to increase the weight. Just be sure to use the same amount on each side of the machine for the most balanced workout. If you’re a beginner, try lifting about ⅓ or ½ of your body weight. If you’re more experienced, you can try lifting weights that are heavier than your body weight. It will take a little time to find the right weight to complete your reps, so choose whatever you’re most comfortable with. 2. Secure the strap or padded bar over your hips. Sit down on the machine’s seat so you’re facing the foot rest. Your machine will either have a padded metal bar or a strap with a buckle near your hips so you’re able to lift the weight. If there’s a strap, pull it tight over the front of your hips and buckle it in. Pull on the strap’s loose end to tighten it. If the machine has a padded bar, then swing it over your hips so the end fits in the latch. Secure the latch so the bar sits just over your lap. If you’re only doing bodyweight hip thrusts, then you don’t need to use the padded bar or strap since you aren’t lifting weights. 3. Press your back and shoulders into the back support. Lean your upper body back against the support until you’re firmly pressed against it. Make solid contact with the support using the bottom of your shoulder blades and your lower back so you don’t practice bad form. Make sure your back doesn’t arch off of the support, or else you’re more likely to get hurt. The size of the back support may vary depending on the machine you’re using. If the support isn’t long enough to reach your lower back, then only but your shoulder blades against it. Just be extra mindful to keep your back straight throughout the exercise. 4. Position your feet shoulder-width on the foot rest. Bend your knees at a 90-degree angle and place them near the center of the foot rest. Keep your toes pointed forward and your feet shoulder-width apart so you get the most support throughout the exercise. Press your heels firmly against the rest. Try putting your feet higher on the foot rest if you’d rather target your hamstrings or lumbar muscles. 5. Lift your hips up to raise the weight out of the safety. Keep your heels and back pressed into the rests so you don’t fall down or slip. Squeeze your glutes together to bring your hips off of the seat. You will be lifting the weights to get into position, so it may feel a little heavy at first. Push up until your upper legs and upper body form a straight line. If you’re struggling to lift your hips up, you may have too much weight on the bar. Try using the next lowest weights to see if you can manage it easier. 6. Disengage the safety to work your full range of motion. Look for a vertical safety bar that’s supporting the weight on the machine. Push the locking bar forward or pull the lever to turn off the safety. That way, you can lower your hips and the weight even further so you get a more even workout. Once you disengage the safety, you’ll be supporting the weight on your own and it could drop. Have someone nearby to spot you so you don’t get injured. 7. Drop your hips until they form a 90-degree angle with your body. Using slow and controlled movement, relax your glutes to move your hips back down. Now that you turned the safety off, the weight will drop lower than it did before so you can feel get a deeper workout. Once you reach the bottom of the motion, hold your position for 1 count. Avoid letting your hips drop quickly because you could hurt yourself. 8. Push the weight up with your hips to finish a rep. Squeeze your glutes together to force your hips back up toward your starting position. Keep your core engaged so you can lift the weight back up easier. Once your legs and body are in line, hold that position for another count. Be careful not to overextend your hips since you could damage your muscles. 9. Try to do 1–3 sets that are each 6–12 reps. Continue lowering and raising your hips until you finish all of your reps. Take a short 60-second break in between each of your sets so you have some time to recover. Once you finish all of your sets, you should feel exhausted but not completely burnt out. If you aren’t able to finish all of your reps and sets, try decreasing how much weight you’re using. 10. Activate the locking bar when you’re finished exercising. Once you complete your last set, lift your hips one last time to the top starting position. Pull the locking bar toward you to re-engage the safety so you don’t have to support the weight anymore. Slowly lower your body back into the seat so you can relax. If you struggle to lift the weight back up so you can activate the safety, ask a spotter to help you. Don’t forget to put the plates away so the next person doesn’t have to.",

Make sure there's enough space for the barbell to be loaded and to roll over your hips. If your machine has a foot platform, ensure it's at a comfortable distance.\n\n\n**Step 2: Load the Weight**\n\nCarefully load the desired weight onto the barbell. Start with a lighter weight to perfect your form before increasing the load. Use clips to secure the weight plates.\n\n\n**Step 3: Position Yourself**\n\nSit on the floor with your upper back against the bench pad. Roll the barbell over your hips until it rests comfortably in your hip crease. You might want to use a pad or towel for cushioning. Place your feet flat on the floor, about shoulder-width apart, with your knees bent. Your shins should be relatively vertical at the top of the movement.\n\n\n**Step 4: The Ascent (Thrust)**\n\nEngage your glutes and core. Drive through your heels and lift your hips off the floor, pushing the barbell upwards. Your body should form a straight line from your shoulders to your knees at the top of the movement. Squeeze your glutes hard at the peak.\n\n\n**Step 5: The Descent**\n\nSlowly and controlled, lower your hips back down towards the floor. Maintain tension in your glutes throughout the entire movement. Don't let the weight just drop.\n",

    "prompt": "How to do a pull-up correctly? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Grip a pull-up bar with your hands slightly wider than your shoulders. For a classic pull-up, hold the pull-up bar with your palms facing away from you. Keep your arms extended and hang from the bar with your feet off the ground, either straight or with your knees bent slightly. Or, for a slightly easier variation, position your hands so your palms are facing you. This is also called a “chinup” and more intensely works your lats. 2. Use your arms to pull your body up until your chin is just above the bar. While only moving your arms, pull yourself straight upwards while exhaling. Imagine yourself pulling your elbows downward. Aim for a smooth and unhurried ascent (count “one Mississippi” to help pace yourself) and pull until your chin only just clears the pull-up bar. To keep your bodyweight centered, cross your feet beneath you as you lift yourself up and engage your core. Pull your shoulder blades down and inward. Avoid kicking your feet or arching your back to complete a pull-up. It doesn’t improve your strength, and may lead to injury. 3. Lower yourself until your arms are fully extended. After just a moment, inhale and lower yourself back down until your arms are fully extended once more. As on the way up, move at a controlled pace to work the muscles harder and prep yourself for the next pull. Start with a single pull-up, and work your way up to about 5. Then, each day, try 2-3 sets of 5, gradually increasing the reps until you can do sets of 10. 4. Negative pull-ups A negative pull-up is only the downward portion of a pull-up, and is a good way to get your arms used to holding your weight. To do one, stand on a platform or chair so that your chin starts above the bar. Engage your arms, and lower yourself as with a normal pull-up, then step back onto the platform and repeat. 5. Assisted pull-ups These are done using a bar that’s lower to the ground, about 3–4 ft (0.91–1.22 m) from the floor. Start from a sitting position and complete a pull-up as usual, lifting your body off the ground with only your arms. These enable you to build up strength by lifting only part of your body weight with each rep. Or, wrap elastic workout bands around your feet and the pull-up bar, to help you keep your body weight aloft. 6. Jumping pull-ups When you jump into a pull-up, the momentum you gain with the jump helps propel your body up so you can lift your chin over the bar much more easily than you'd be able to otherwise. Then, slowly ease your body weight back down, until your arms are extended. This is great practice for doing classic pull-ups. 7. Wide and narrow grip pull-ups Perform a wide-grip pull-up by placing your hands 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) wider than usual, which more intensely engages your lats and helps strengthen and broaden your upper back. A close-gripped pull-up place your hands 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) closer to each other than usual, and strengthens your biceps and grip strength. 8. Weighted pull-ups A weighted pull-up is just like a standard pull-up, but with added weight, making your muscles work overtime to build strength faster and more effectively. Strap on a 5–10 lb (2.3–4.5 kg) weighted workout belt and perform your usual pull-up, and add weight a little at a time when you acclimate to the current weight. Reader Poll: We asked 400 wikiHow readers and 51% of them agreed that the best exercise for building arm strength is weighted pull-ups . [Take Poll] If your goal is to get stronger arms, this exercise is proven to work! 9. Ring pull-ups These use gymnastic rings instead of a standard pull-up bar, which adds a level of instability that forces you to engage more muscles throughout your body in order to stay balanced and in control. You may hold the rings with your palms facing away, toward you, or in neutral position—whatever you do, try not to move the rings at all during the exercise, keeping your hands stationary. 10. One-handed pull-up This is exactly what it sounds like: a pull-up using just 1 arm. It’s great to more intensely work the muscles on one side of your body, improve grip strength, and train for things like climbing. It’s not for the faint of heart, and only adept pull-up pros should attempt it. Otherwise, you may risk injury. 11. Start by hanging from the bar for 10-20 seconds. Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialist Adam Shuty recommends starting your pull-up journey with simple bar hangs. [12] X Expert Source Adam Shuty Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder width on the bar with your palms facing away, then bend your knees slightly to lift your feet off the ground and hang your body weight from the bar, with your arms extended. Hang for 10-20 seconds at a time, and increase your time in intervals of 10 seconds once it becomes easy. Certified personal trainer Monica Morris recommends flexing your shoulders up and down while you hang to prepare them for a proper pull-up. [13] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview 12. Perform bicep curls to increase your arm strength. To perform a bicep curl , hold a dumbbell low at arm’s length with your palm facing away from you. Then, while keeping your elbow close to your torso, bend it so that the dumbbell comes up near your shoulder. Finally, slowly lower the dumbbell until your arm is extended. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Repeat for 3 sets of 10 curls. Start with a weight you can lift 10 times without much fatigue, then move up to the next available weight. 13. Perform inverted rows to strengthen your upper body. This exercise simulates a pull-up, but is easier to do since most of your weight is on the ground. It's an excellent way to start building up enough strength to do a pull-up. Lie on your back under a dip bar or a secured barbell, and grip the bar with your palms facing down and just wider than your shoulders. Then, use your arms to pull your chest up to the bar, and gradually lower yourself back down. Complete 2-3 sets of 10 inverted rows per workout. 14. Use a pulldown machine to simulate pull-ups. A pulldown machine strengthens your upper body , lats, and backs, which are major muscle groups employed during a pull-up. Stand or sit under a pulldown bar and grip it with your palms facing away. Then, use your arms to pull the bar down to your collarbone, and steadily let it raise back up. Perform 2-3 sets of 10 reps each, increasing reps and weight when it becomes almost effortless. 15. Practice easier pull-up variations, like chin-ups. Shuty recommends building up your arm, chest, and back strength with easier pull up variations, like those in the section above: chinups, negatives, assisted pull-ups, and jumping pull-ups. [17] X Expert Source Adam Shuty Certified Strength & Conditioning Specialist Expert Interview These will help ease you into a proper, unassisted pull-up. Perform 2-3 sets of 10 reps per exercise, until you can do them without strain. Then, attempt a full pull-up!",

Your chest should be close to or touching the bar. Avoid kipping or using momentum; the movement should be controlled.\n\n**Step 4: The Descent**\nSlowly and with control, lower yourself back down to the starting position.

If you aren't a member of a gym, you can buy a chin-up bar and install it in your house. Place it in a tall doorway and make sure it's positioned above your shoulders. 2. Put your hands on the bar with your palms facing your body. [2] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview Whereas a pull-up would begin with your palms facing away, a chin-up begins with your palms facing your body. This is called an underhand grip. Grip the bar comfortably but firmly, with your hands spaced shoulder-width apart. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source 3. Raise your body until your chin is above the bar. Use your upper arm strength to lift your body toward the bar, stopping when your chin is above the bar. Your elbows will be fully bent. Bend your knees or cross your feet to distribute your weight more evenly. 4. Lower yourself back down. Using a slow, controlled motion, lower yourself until your arms are straight. This is the complete range of motion for a chin-up. 5. Do isometric chin-ups. Stand on a chair and grip the bar as though you were going to do a chin-up. Bend your knees as much as you need to so that your chin is just above the bar. Move your feet off of the chair and hang in this position for 30 seconds or as long as you can. [4] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview After 30 seconds, lower yourself back down until your arms are straight. Repeat this five times. [5] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source It's important that when you lower yourself down it's slow and controlled. You use the same muscles on the way down that you use on the way up. This exercise will help to train your muscles to perform a chin-up without the help of a chair. [6] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview Reader Poll: We asked 310 wikiHow readers how they liked to refuel after a workout, and 52% of them said protein shake. [Take Poll] 6. Start from slightly below the bar. This time, stand on the chair and position yourself so that your head is slightly below the bar. Your arms should be at a 90-degree angle. Starting from this position, pull yourself up so that your chin is past the bar. Repeat five times starting from the same position. Lower yourself halfway down in a slow and controlled manner. After a while you'll notice that you'll be able to start from lower and lower down. 7. Repeat these exercises for several weeks. Each time, try to start the exercises from a lower position. Eventually start from a full hang, with your arms completely straight. See how far you can pull yourself up five times in a row. 8. Increase your number of reps. When you can do a full chin-up, pull yourself up five times in a row, or as many times as possible. You can also do a combination of full chin-ups and half chin-ups. As your muscles gain strength, increase your reps. You should be able to increase your reps every other week or so. Don't overdo it. You don't want to tear a muscle or overexert yourself. Rest between sessions to give your muscles time to repair and get stronger.",

[1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview Sit on the edge of the bench and put a hand down on either side of your legs. Your hands should be about shoulder-width apart. Straighten out your arms. Place your feet flat on the ground with your knees at a 90-degree angle. Raising your feet off of the ground will make the exercise more challenging. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 2. Tighten your core and lower your body off the bench. Squeeze your core muscles to tighten them. Move yourself off the front edge of the bench and use your arms to lower yourself down toward the floor. Don't go all the way down. Dip down enough that your elbows end up at a 90-degree angle. 3. Keep your head and upper body straight. As you dip, make sure your body stays upright. Look straight ahead to remind yourself not to dip your head while you're performing a dip. Also, keep your elbows close to your body. 4. Hold the dipped position for 1-2 seconds before pushing back up. When you reach the bottom of the dip, stay there for a couple of seconds. That will force your arm muscles to work harder while you hold yourself in place. Once you've held the position, move your body back up, keeping your core tight as you do. At the top, lock your elbows momentarily. 5. Move yourself up and down without returning to the bench. Keep going for the whole set, doing 8 to 10 reps at a time. When you move your body down, try to do it in slow motion. Moving more slowly works your muscles harder. Try 2-3 sets at a time. For a variation, straighten your legs out in front of you instead of bending at the knees.",

Wrists neutral, thumbs around bars.\n   * Press down to lift your body; legs slightly bent and crossed behind you.\n   * Set your shoulders: **down and back** (depress & lightly retract). Brace your core.\n\n2. **Descent**\n\n   * Inhale. Lean your torso slightly forward.\n   * Bend elbows, letting them travel **back at ~30–45°**, not flared wide.\n   * Keep forearms close to vertical; don’t shrug.\n\n3. **Bottom position**\n\n   * Stop when **upper arms are about parallel** to the floor (or a touch below) **without shoulder pain**.\n   * Chest open, neck neutral, scapulae still depressed.\n\n4. **Drive up**\n\n   * Exhale and **push the bars straight down**.\n   * Think “chest up, shoulders down.”\n   * Elbows extend while staying stacked over wrists.\n\n5. **Lockout**\n\n   * Finish tall with elbows straight (not hyperextended).\n   * Reset shoulder position before the next rep. Breathe, then repeat.\n\n---\n\n### Tips & Cues\n\n* “**Push the bars to the floor**,” “**shoulders down**,” “**elbows back, not out**.”\n* Tempo for control: **2–3s down, 1s up**, pause briefly at the top.\n* Start with **3–4 sets of 5–8 reps**; leave 1–2 reps in reserve.\n\n### Common Mistakes\n\n* Elbows flaring wide.\n* Shoulders shrugging toward ears.\n* Half-depth reps or bouncing at the bottom.\n* Swinging/kipping or craning the neck forward.\n\n### Progressions & Regressions\n\n* **Easier:** band-assisted dips, feet on a box, or eccentric-only (slow lower, step up).\n* **Harder:** pause at the bottom for 1–2s, add weight with a dip belt, or do ring dips (advanced).\n\n> If you feel shoulder discomfort, reduce depth, slow the tempo, or switch to assisted versions until you build strength and control.",

    "prompt": "How to Do a Straddle Press Handstand? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Start in a seated straddle position. Sit down on your butt with your legs extended out to either side of your body at roughly a 45-degree angle. Engage your glutes to hold your legs straight and firm and rotate your knees in slightly, which will help you engage your core in turn. When you’re reading to begin the press, place your hands shoulder-width apart on the floor in front of you. There’s no single best width where the straddle is concerned—a wider straddle will provide better leg clearance but requires more strength, whereas a narrower straddle will offer greater stability but will make it harder to get your legs out of the way. Do what’s most comfortable for you. If you prefer, you can also start in a standing position, with your feet a little wider than hip-width apart and your hands on the floor directly beneath your shoulders. This position will give you a little more leverage, which can be helpful if you don’t have the strength required to press all the way up from the floor. 2. Lean forward over your hands slowly. As your torso begins to tilt, transfer your weight from your lower body to your hands. Press your palms firmly into the floor and maintaining a small amount of bend in your elbows. Spread your fingers out on the floor as much as you can to create a wider base and lend added stability to your handstand. 3. Engage your core as you continue leaning to begin lifting your legs. Tense the muscles of your midsection tight. You should be able to feel an equal amount of tension in your upper and lower abs, hips, and pelvis. Imagine that your entire upper body from the crown of your head to your tailbone is one straight line. Focus on keeping your torso as rigid as possible during the first part of the press. If you’re too loose, your own weight will be working against you, decreasing your leverage and pulling you off balance. Make sure your head stays well in front of your hands to serve as a counter-lever to your lower body. If you can look down between your hands, you’re not leaning out far enough. 4. Keep your shoulders ahead of your hips until your feet clear the floor. Continue shifting more and more of your weight forward. Finding a good point of balance between your head and your hips is crucial at this stage, as most of your lower body will still be behind you. When only your toes remain on the floor, you’re ready to begin pulling upward into the handstand. Extend your shoulders completely by pushing your straight arms down away from your head. This will distribute more of your weight among your trapezius, scapula, and core muscles, which are much stronger than the muscles of the arms themselves. Avoid letting your knees bend, if you can help it. Just like a loose torso, relaxed legs can create an imbalance. 5. Pick your legs up off of the floor and raise them out to the sides. Without breaking your forward lean, tighten your glutes, hamstrings, and core to prepare to lift your legs. In one controlled movement, sweep them back behind you and upwards. As they leave the floor, your upper and lower body will briefly be in the same configuration they were in in your starting position, only inverted. Don’t rush the leg lift. Doing so could cause you to wobble or overshoot your mark and fall forward. The key to a solid straddle press is to perform each movement in a slow, controlled manner. Keep your awareness on your hands, arms, and shoulders as your legs come up. Otherwise, you may lose tightness and topple over prematurely. 6. Bring your legs together over your head to complete the handstand. As you straighten your legs, your hips will naturally move into alignment with your shoulders. At this point, you can stop leaning forward and concentrate on fine-tuning your balance through your hands. Maintain this “stacked” position to hold the handstand for as long as you can. Dialing in your handstand may feel harder than normal, since you’ll already be fatigued. Do your best to hold the position with good form for 5-10 seconds, then gradually increase your time to build up your endurance. If you need some assistance, practice pressing up against a wall, or have a friend spot you by holding your hips once you get inverted. The added support will help you learn how to transition between each part of the movement without having to worry about maintaining your balance. 7. Lower yourself back down to the floor by reversing the sequence. With your core nice and tight, slowly separate your legs and begin hinging at the waist to bring them down in front of your body. Lean forward and keep your head in front of your hands like you did on the way up to maintain your balance. Place your feet on the floor and stand up if you started in a standing position. If you pressed up from seated position, bend your arms to bring yourself back down to a seated straddle. As your straddle press handstands improve, you can start performing multiple “reps,” going from straddle to handstand and back again without ever setting your full weight back down. 8. Practice your straddle press handstand frequently. The straddle press handstand is an advanced-level skill that requires a tremendous amount of strength, balance, flexibility and coordination. Make it a point to develop each part of the movement individually until it becomes easy to transition to the next stage. Not only will a slow progression help you prioritize proper form from beginning to end, it will also minimize your risk of injury. Try to set aside 15-30 minutes per day to practice. The more you train, the quicker you’ll get the hang of it. Stop practicing when you feel your form start to slip. You don’t want to get in the habit of performing the movement with poor technique.",

    "Gemini_text": "Here's a breakdown of how to achieve a straddle press handstand, with visual aids:\n\n**Step 1: Warm-up and Wrist Preparation**\n\nBefore attempting any handstand, it's crucial to thoroughly warm up your wrists, shoulders, and core. Perform wrist circles, push-up pluses, and some light stretching.\n\n**Step 2: Pike Compression Practice**\n\nPike compression is key. Sit on the floor with straight legs, and try to bring your chest as close to your thighs as possible. This builds the necessary core strength and flexibility. **Step 3: Elevated Pike Press (or Pike Handstand Prep)**\n\nPlace your hands on the floor and your feet on an elevated surface (like a yoga block or low step) in a pike position. Practice lifting one leg at a time, focusing on keeping your hips stacked over your shoulders. This helps you get used to the inverted position and balance.\n\n**Step 4: Straddle Leg Lifts (on the floor)**\n\nFrom a seated straddle position, place your hands on the floor in front of you. Lean forward and try to lift your hips off the ground, engaging your core and pressing through your hands. This simulates the initial lift of the straddle press.\n\n**Step 5: Full Straddle Press Handstand**\n\nStart in a deep straddle pike. Place your hands shoulder-width apart, fingers spread. Shift your weight forward, lifting your hips and engaging your core. As your hips rise, slowly press up into a handstand, keeping your legs straddled until you find your balance, then bring them together.\n\n",

    "prompt": "How to Do a Tricep Workout? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Perform an overhead triceps extension for a basic way to flex. Pick up a pair of dumbbells that aren’t too heavy for you, then stand up straight. Lift your arms straight up over your head. Then, bend your elbows to lower the dumbbells behind your head. Do 3 sets of up to 12 repetitions for a decent challenge. This exercise can also be done sitting down. It’s a little easier when you’re sitting on a chair or bench since you don’t have to try as hard to stay balanced. 2. Practice a dumbbell jab if you wish to increase your endurance. Pick up a couple of light dumbbells and stand up straight with your legs shoulder-width apart. Hold the dumbbells up close to your body with your elbows bent and your palms facing one another. Then, push one of the dumbbells forward and across your body like you’re boxing. Repeat the motion with your other hand, doing up to 2 sets of 12 repetitions with each arm. Keep the dumbbells level with your shoulders as you move them. Tense your core muscles to maintain your form. In addition to testing your endurance, jabs work your chest, abs, and other muscles. Work up a sweat as part of your routine or to warm up for tougher exercises! 3. Do triceps kickbacks with a bench for stable strengthening. Stand next to a weight bench, then plant one knee and hand on it. While holding a dumbbell at your side, raise your free arm up until it’s about level with your back. Do the kickback by moving the dumbbell back toward your feet until your arm straightens out and is parallel to the floor. Do about 3 sets of 12 repetitions on each side to complete the exercise. This exercise is all about moving slowly, so take your time with it. Stop if your elbow feels stiff and switch to a lighter weight. You could do this exercise while standing. Bend forward to level out your back like you would while leaning on a bench. 4. Try lying dumbbell extensions for an easy way to isolate triceps. Grab a pair of dumbbells, then lie down on a bench. Raise your arms straight up to the ceiling, then bring the dumbbells back down to the top of your head. Hold your forearms still while you do this so your triceps do the work. Go through 3 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions each to complete the exercise. There are a couple of different ways to hold the dumbbells, so choose whichever one feels more comfortable. You could position them horizontally with your palms facing up or vertically with your hands wrapped around them. 5. Do a dumbbell bench press if you’re looking to strengthen your arms. Lie down on a bench, tucking your arms close to your chest. Keep your elbows bent, then push the dumbbells up above your chest. Bring the dumbbells back down and repeat the motion for 3 sets of 10 to 12 repetitions each. This exercise hits your triceps hard but it also engages your shoulders and chest. It’s a simplified version of the bench press done with a barbell. Reader Poll: We asked 649 wikiHow readers what type of exercise they enjoy most for arm workouts, and 72% of them said weightlifting. [Take Poll] 6. Do cross-body unilateral exercises to flex the sides of your triceps. Sit down on a bench, facing the side. Plant your hand near the edge of the bench and lean toward it so your body is at about a 75-degree angle. Using your opposite hand, raise a dumbbell straight up above your head. Bring the dumbbell down behind your head while keeping your forearm still. Complete 3 sets of up to 12 repetitions with each arm. Use this exercise to stretch out each triceps individually. The motion is a lot different than most other exercises, so it’s a good way to add variety to your routine. Another option is to lay down on the bench and bring the dumbbell down toward your forehead. Work on your triceps one at a time for greater strength and stability.",

Too hard? Drop to knees or elevate hands on a bench.\n* Cues: Squeeze glutes, brace core, keep neck neutral.\n\n2. Bench/Chair Dips\n\n* Sit on a sturdy bench/chair, hands on the edge beside hips, fingers forward; scoot hips off the edge. Knees bent ~90°.\n* Lower by bending elbows straight back until about 90°, then press up without shrugging.\n* Reps: 8–15. Make it harder by straightening legs.\n* Cues: Chest tall, shoulders down and back; don’t sink shoulders or flare elbows wide.\n\n3. Overhead Dumbbell Extension\n\n* Stand or sit tall, hold one dumbbell with both hands above head; upper arms vertical, ribs down.\n* Bend elbows to lower the weight behind your head, then extend to straight, keeping elbows pointing forward.\n* Reps: 10–15.\n* Cues: Brace your core; move only at the elbows.\n\n4. Dumbbell Kickback\n\n* Hinge at the hips with a flat back; hold dumbbells at sides, elbows bent ~90°, upper arms parallel to torso.\n* Extend forearms straight back and squeeze triceps; return slowly.\n* Reps: 10–15.\n* Cues: Keep upper arms glued to your sides; avoid swinging.\n\nQuick workout format\n\n* Do Steps 1–4 as a circuit, **2–4 rounds**. Rest **60–90 sec** between rounds.\n* Choose loads that leave **1–2 reps in reserve** each set.\n* Finish with a gentle triceps/shoulder stretch. Stop if you feel sharp pain.\n\nIf you want swaps (resistance bands, cables) or a version for home/no weights, I can tailor it!",

    "prompt": "How to do a bench press? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Begin by lying flat on the bench, with your body in a natural and relaxed position. Make sure that you are not holding your shoulders in an awkward position. Be sure to have a natural spinal curve. You do not want to have your lower back flat on the bench, but you do not want to force it to curve too much either. Instead, opt for a comfortable and natural position. You should have your feet flat on the ground, shoulder-width apart, and your shoulders touching the bench. Do not lift on a \"cushiony bench\" if you are a heavy lifter. When the bar and plates weigh more than 200 pounds plus the weight of your upper body, your shoulders will disappear into the bench and cause neck strain. Choose a proper bench that fits your shoulder width. A narrow bench is unstable and a wide bench prevents the upper arm from bending back. 2. Put your arms straight out to either side of you, and then bend your elbows, bringing your hands up to touch the bar. This is where you should position your hands. They should be about shoulder-width apart. Use the smooth rings in the bar as a reference for even hand placement. Where you position your hands will affect which muscle group you work most. Widen your grip slightly to increase the amount of pectoral muscles involved in this exercise, and bring your grip in slightly to increase your triceps involvement. For a standard bench press, opt for the normal grip. 3. Begin with just the bar weight to warm up before heavy lifting. Lift the bar off the rack and position it directly above the middle of your chest. Inhale as you lower it down, gently touching your chest — the middle of the sternum — with the bar. Do not bounce the bar off your chest, as this can cause serious injury and promotes bad form . Begin to exhale as you push the bar up and away from your body. Extend your arms to just under full extension. Repeat this for eight repetitions as your first set. Lift with a bar that has a little flex but is not \"whippy\". A stiff bar can be uncomfortable to lift with. All bars are made of metal and relatively stiff, but a bar with some flex feels better on the joints. The salesperson at the store will give you the right bar for your bodyweight, based on the formula for bodyweight and bench press. Generally, a beginning or intermediate lifter is not going to lift over his bodyweight plus 50%. Examine your goals when choosing a bar. For setting a personal record or a state record and above, use a bar with a standard diameter of 1 1 ⁄ 16 inches (2.7 cm). If not concerned with records, a thicker bar does not dig into the palms and is more comfortable. A thicker bar increases the distance of the lift and decreases the amount that can be lifted. A 1/8 (or 1/16) inch increase in bar diameter has a noticeable difference in feel and stability. 4. Rack the bar and add weight. Always use weight clips to prevent the weights from sliding off the bar in the event that you lift unevenly, do not lift without them. The bar by itself weighs 45 pounds. You will want to increase by five to ten pounds at a time until you find a comfortable weight. Practice extra caution if tall. Tall lifters with wide grips should use care not to crush their hands when racking the bar. Weight benches were made for someone tall (6 feet tall and not for a lifter 6 feet 8 inches tall). Tall lifters should not use an extra wide grip. An extra wide grip strains the wrist with excessive radial flexion. Close and wide grips can make the wrist more prone to injury. Avoid using the thumbless grip. If the bar slips off your hands, it would be disastrous. When being spotted by spotters and by a spotting device the thumbless grip is not as dangerous, but the spotting device has to be very, very solid. The thumbless grips is easier on the wrist and conducts power to the bar more directly (you can lift more). Use chalk with both grips. There are lifters who will use the thumbless grips despite the possible danger. 5. Be sure to have a spotter to help you whenever you lift a heavy weight. You never want to drop the bar on yourself. You also want to be able to max out and be able to recover when you no longer can lift the bar. A spotter will be able to help you recover from your final press. 6. Lift the bar up, slowly bring it down to just above your sternum, and explode upward for one rep. Pay attention to your form as you add more weight. It's easier to bend your wrists, bounce the weight off your chest, and exhibit other \"no-nos\" when trying to lift big. You'll gain more muscle and strength lifting the right form and lower weight than you will lifting with higher weight and the wrong form. Lifters generally do between 8 and 12 reps (also called \"repetitions\") and 3 to six sets (one set is the maximum numbers of reps you give yourself). 7. Drink plenty of water and take at least two minute breaks between each set. Water will help you stay hydrated and allow your muscles to function at high capacity, giving you an overall better workout. 8. Rest according to how you feel between sets. Some guides say the ideal rest time between sets is 90 to 120 seconds. While this is perhaps a good general guide for increasing muscle mass, it may not be ideal for you as an individual. You probably don't want to overshoot the 2-3 minute range, but you don't want to rush yourself into lifting thin. If your ultimate goal is gaining muscle and mass, you're going to want to shock your body. How you do this is up to you. It can mean cutting down on rest time, increasing poundage on lifts, supersetting, etc. As long as you manage to keep pushing your body physically, you will notice a difference.",

Pull to the upper chest\n\n* Drive elbows toward the floor, bar traveling in front of your face.\n* Touch (or nearly touch) the top of your chest, just below the collarbones.\n* Keep forearms vertical; avoid shrugging.\n\n6. Squeeze & pause\n\n* Brief 1-second pause; feel lats contracting while shoulders stay down.\n\n7. Controlled return\n\n* Let the bar rise over 2–3 seconds, arms straightening without losing shoulder control.\n* Keep tension; don’t let the weight stack slam.\n\n8. Breathe\n\n* Inhale at the top (stretch), exhale as you pull down; small breath hold through the hardest part is okay if you’re experienced and blood pressure is normal.\n\n9. Tempo & range\n\n* Full comfortable stretch at the top without shoulder roll-forward; smooth, no swinging.\n* Typical tempo: 2–3s down, 1s pause, 2–3s up.\n\n10. Sets & reps\n\n* Hypertrophy: 3–4 sets × 8–12 reps.\n* Strength: 4–5 sets × 5–8 reps (slightly heavier, perfect form).\n* Beginners: start with 2–3 sets × 10–12 reps light.\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n* Pulling the bar **behind the neck** (unnecessary shoulder stress).\n* Using momentum/leaning way back (turns it into a row).\n* Gripping **too wide** (shortens range, stresses shoulders) or too narrow (turns into more biceps).\n* Shrugging shoulders up toward ears.\n* Breaking wrists (bent wrists reduce transfer of force).\n\n## Variations\n\n* Neutral-grip (V-bar) pulldown: easier on shoulders, great lat engagement.\n* Underhand (supinated) pulldown: more biceps, slightly lower-lat bias.\n* Single-arm cable pulldown: fixes imbalances, allows tailored line of pull.\n* Pause or 1½-rep pulldowns: increase time under tension.\n\n## Form Cues (quick reminders)\n\n“Chest tall, ribs down • Elbows to pockets • Bar to upper chest • Control the return • Don’t shrug.”\n\nIf you want, I can also generate alternate visuals (e.g., neutral-grip version, single-arm version) to match your equipment.",

Here's how to do it with proper form:\n\n**Step 1: Setup**\nAdjust the knee pad so your thighs are snug under it when seated. This will help keep you stable during the exercise. Reach up and grasp the bar with an overhand grip, slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your arms should be fully extended.\n\n\n**Step 2: Initiate the Pull**\nLean back slightly (about 15-30 degrees) and puff out your chest. Take a deep breath and, as you exhale, begin to pull the bar down towards your upper chest. Focus on driving your elbows down and back, squeezing your shoulder blades together.\n**Step 3: The Contraction**\nContinue to pull the bar down until it's just above your upper chest or clavicle. At this point, your lats should be fully contracted. Hold the contraction for a brief moment, really feeling the squeeze in your back muscles.\n\n\n**Step 4: Controlled Release**\nSlowly and with control, allow the bar to ascend back to the starting position. Resist the urge to let the weight snap back up quickly. Keep your core engaged and maintain tension in your lats throughout the upward movement.\n",

Stretch your arms up as high as you can so that your hands and feet are as far apart as possible. 2. Lean into the roll. Keeping your knees as straight as possible, move your arms, head, and trunk down as one unit. You should not be bending down at the waist. Instead, try to keep your torso and legs in a line, which means your legs should go down as your torso lowers to the ground. Reach toward the ground as you lean into the roll. Your hands will connect with the floor as your body goes down as one unit in an almost straight line. 3. Push your hips forward when your hands touch the floor. Your hands should touch the floor with your fingers pointing ahead of you. Your upper body should be all lined up with your hips slightly elevated. Bring your hips forward with your legs following. Make sure to keep your legs straight. Don’t fling your legs over your body. Move your chin towards your chest to protect your neck. 4. Roll forward onto your back. Keep your legs straight as you flip over on your hands in a slow, controlled motion. Bend your arms slightly as you roll onto your back. As you roll onto your back, tuck your knees towards your chest. Grasp your shins or your knees as your roll forward. 5. Stand up. As you roll from your back to a vertical position, roll flat onto your feet. As soon as your feet are flat on the floor, lift your arms over your head as you stand up. 6. Try a dive roll after you’ve mastered the front roll. Doing a dive roll will help you transition to a front flip. It’s similar to a front roll, but you jump instead of slowly lowering yourself into a roll. Start by running forward and jump from the balls of your feet. Keep your knees as straight as possible. Just like with the front roll, keep your body as straight as possible. When you jump, jump forward as you reach your arms forward toward the floor. When your hands touch the floor, go into the normal front roll you’ve already mastered.",

    "Gemini_text": "A front flip, also known as a front somersault, is an exciting acrobatic move that involves rotating your body 360 degrees forward in the air. While it looks impressive, it requires practice, proper technique, and a safe environment. Here's a breakdown of how to approach learning a front flip:\n\n**Step 1: Build Foundational Skills and Warm-up**\nBefore attempting a front flip, ensure you have a good level of physical fitness, including core strength, leg power, and flexibility. Start with a thorough warm-up, including dynamic stretches and light cardio, to prepare your muscles and joints. Practice basic tumbling skills like forward rolls and handstands to get comfortable with inversions.\n\n**Step 2: The Take-Off**\nThe take-off is crucial for generating height and forward momentum. Start with a few steps to build speed. As you approach your take-off point, your last two steps should be quick and powerful. Explode upwards, driving your knees towards your chest. Your arms should swing up vigorously to aid in the lift.\n**Step 3: The Tuck**\nImmediately after your take-off, bring your knees as close to your chest as possible and grab your shins or the back of your thighs. This tight tuck position reduces your body's moment of inertia, allowing you to rotate faster. Keep your head neutral or slightly tucked, looking towards your knees.\n**Step 4: The Rotation**\nAs you tuck, your body will naturally begin to rotate forward. Focus on maintaining a tight tuck throughout the rotation. Keep your eyes open to spot your landing. The speed of your rotation will depend on the power of your take-off and the tightness of your tuck.\n**Step 5: The Untuck and Landing**\nOnce you've completed about three-quarters of the rotation and can spot the ground, begin to untuck your body. Extend your legs downwards, preparing for landing. Absorb the impact by bending your knees and hips. Try to land with your feet shoulder-width apart, arms out for balance.\n",

    "prompt": "How to do a lateral raise with dumbbells? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Choose your weights. Select a few different dumbbell sizes to experiment with lifting. Make sure you can lift the dumbbell comfortably and repeatedly. Your focus for lateral raises will be building muscle tone, not on lifting heavy weights. While dumbbells are most popularly used for this exercise, they are not a requirement for doing lateral raises. You can use a resistance band if you’d prefer not to use dumbbells. The main difference between using a resistance band versus free weights is that with a resistance band, you will use your feet to keep the band in place as you pull up on the ends of the band. Your form and technique should be the same as it is with free weights. Selecting the correct weight is important and key for lateral raises, but do not get caught up with finding the perfect weight. Using a lighter weight will cause tension and resistance with the more reps you do each set. 2. Stand or sit with a dumbbell in each hand. Keep your legs shoulder-width apart, hip-width apart or in a split-stance position to keep your body stable. 3. Straighten your back and keep your chest out and open. The arm can be straight (but not locked) during this exercise. If you are using dumbbells, you can also bend your elbow at a 90° angle (do not bend the elbow to 90° if you are using a resistance band). 4. Keep your chest up, with a slight bend in your elbows. Pull your shoulder blades down and back. You should feel a slight tension in your shoulders, which is completely normal. 5. Hold a dumbbell in both hands and at your sides. Turn the palms of your hands inward so that they are facing your body. Keep your thumbs wrapped around the dumbbell handles, or turned toward the ceiling if you want to work out different muscle groups. Get your torso ready for the raises by tightening your abs and core muscles. If you are using a resistance band, stand on the center of the band and take a handle or end of the band in each hand. There should be some tension in the band. 6. Raise the dumbbells out to the sides, just below shoulder-height. Slowly lift each dumbbell out to the sides, like wings, until your arms are almost parallel to the ground, almost at shoulder-height. Slowly exhale as you use the muscles in the top of your shoulder to lift the dumbbells. Keep your head straight and aligned with your spine. It the lats are engaged, and the shoulder blades are retracted (as they are supposed to be), it is impossible to lift the arms above shoulder height. If the arms go above shoulder height, the lats are not engaged. If you are doing the exercise correctly, your arms will not go higher than the shoulders. If you are using a resistance band, lift the ends of the band as you raise your arms to shoulder-height or just slightly below. Hold the raise for two to three seconds with a slight bend in your elbow. Allow yourself to build a little tension in your shoulder, making the workout more effective. Keep your core engaged and stabilized. Do not flex your wrists or position your arm so that your wrists are higher than your elbows (they should be roughly at the same height or in line). If your wrists are held too high you will shift the work away from your shoulders. To prevent this, imagine the dumbbell is actually a bottle of water and you are tilting it forward to pour out the water. Reader Poll: We asked 310 wikiHow readers how they liked to refuel after a workout, and 52% of them said protein shake. [Take Poll] 7. Lower your arms slowly back to the start position. Take two to three seconds to slowly lower the dumbbells back down to your start position, steadily inhaling as you go. Your movement should be slow and controlled. If you are using a resistance band, slowly lower your hands back to the starting position. Do not allow the tension in the band to pull your arm back for you — this should be a controlled movement.",

    "prompt": "How to Row on a Rowing Machine? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Sit down on the seat and bend your knees. Make sure your bottom feels comfortable on the seat and adjust yourself if necessary. Bend your knees so you can get closer to the base of the machine. Look for a flat surface near the bottom of the base where you feet will go, which is called the footplate. Then, find the handle that's attached to the cord on the machine. The handle will be in the center of the base or near the top of the base. Be careful as you sit down because the seat slides. 2. Secure the footplate strap around the top of your shoelaces. The balls of your feet are the only area that will maintain constant contact with the footplate, since you’ll likely need to lift your heels when your knees are bent. Pull the straps across the top of your foot until your feet feel secure. Make sure your feet don’t slide around on the footplate as this can mess up your form. It's best to wear rubber-soled shoes like sneakers, running shoes, or cross trainers while you're using a rowing machine. This makes it less likely your feet will slip. Don’t tighten the strap so tightly that it hurts. If your feet feel uncomfortable, loosen the straps and try again. 3. Hold the handle using an overhand grip. The cord on the rowing machine has a handgrip that you’ll pull to work your arms. Grab onto the handle and pull it toward you. Adjust your hands on the handle so that they're in an overhand grip, which means your palms are facing down. Using an underhand grip rotates your arms and increases your risk of injury, so it's best to avoid positioning your hands palms up. 4. Engage your core and straighten your posture. Once you have the handle in your hand, check your posture to make sure your back and shoulders are straight. Tighten your core muscles so they’re working as you row. An engaged core also helps keep your posture straight. You don’t want to slump forward or lean too far back as you’re rowing. 5. Extend your arms and bend your knees to get into “the catch.” In rowing, the starting position is called “the catch.” While it might sound complicated, it’s a really natural pose to begin rowing. Pull the handle to extend the cord toward you, but keep your arms extended out away from your body. Then, bend your knees so that your seat is as close to the base of the machine as possible. When you're in the catch position, make sure your torso is hinged forward at your hips, your arms are straight out in front of you, and your shins are no more than perpendicular to the floor. Don't slide your seat as close to your feet as possible, as this can cause you to lean back. If you start your stroke with your shoulders behind your hips, you'll use your back in your push-off, which weakens your stroke and increases your risk of injury. Remember to keep your core engaged. 6. Push off the footplate with your leg muscles. Your legs will do most of the work during your drives. Use the power you have in your leg muscles to push yourself. Keep your arms and upper body neutral at this time. Your legs should do 60% of the work while rowing. 7. Extend your legs until they’re straight. Roll your feet down onto the footplate so that they’re flat once your legs are fully extended. Flow directly into the upper body shift just before your legs are fully extended. 8. Bend at your hips to push your upper body slightly back. Be very careful with this step because you don’t want to curve your spine. Instead, hinge at your waist so that your entire upper body leans back with your spine straight and your core engaged. As soon as you lean back, start pulling with your arms. Your core will do about 20% of the work during your drive. 9. Pull the grip toward your lower rib cage. The arm motion is the final part of a rowing sequence. Bend your elbows to bring the handle toward you. Keep your wrists straight to protect them from injury. Your arms should provide the final 20% of power to complete your drive. 10. Bring your elbows back behind you as you pull the grip. It’s really important to follow through when you do the arm motion so you get the full upper body workout. When the handle is down at your rib cage, make sure your elbows are angled behind you and not at your sides. Keep them close to your body. This position is called “the finish” because it’s the end of the drive. Check that your legs are extended, your core is engaged, your upper body is leaning slightly back, and your handgrip is just below your rib cage. 11. Extend your arms back in front of you. During your recovery, you’ll reverse the order of the drive. Start by straightening out your elbows to push the handle back out in front of you. Once your arms are extended, go directly into the upper body shift. Remember to keep your wrists straight as you do this. Don’t let go of the handle because the cord on the machine might snap back. 12. Hinge forward at your waist until you’re sitting up straight again. Keep your core engaged as you lean back up. Remember to hinge forward at your waist without curving your spine. Your legs will stay fully extended until you’re sitting back up. 13. Bend your knees to slide back to start. You’re almost there! Release the tension in your legs to slide back toward the base of the machine. Bend your legs as far as you comfortably can to return to “the catch” position. This completes 1 stroke. 14. Go directly into your next stroke if your workout isn't finished. A single stroke on a rowing machine has a drive and a recovery. At first, you might focus on mastering your form without worrying about how many strokes you're doing or how long you're rowing. Later, set a time limit to your workout or set a goal for how many meters you'll row. You might also use a preset rowing machine workout. At first, you might set a goal to row for 10 minutes straight. As the exercise becomes easier for you, try increasing your goal by 10 minutes at a time until you can do a 30 to 40 minute workout on the rowing machine. For an interval workout, you might row 1 minute on and then rest for 1 minute. Do this for 30 to 40 minutes to get a full body workout. You might also set a goal to row 1,000 meters. Once this becomes easy for you, try increasing the distance or doing multiple rounds of 1,000 meters with rests in between.",

    "text_ref": "1. Walk it off. Walking is a great way to burn fat and work your abdominal muscles. Walk for 30 minutes at least 5 times a week. To burn the most calories, tighten your abdominal muscles while you're walking. Walk at a brisk pace, where you can talk normally but would have trouble singing, and don't forget to swing those arms! If you need to, start out with shorter walks and work your way up to 30 minutes. 2. Take off running to burn fat quickly. If walking seems a bit slow to you, move up to running. Running can burn as many as 600 to 1,000 calories per hour, and best of all, you don't have to hit the gym to run. If you want to increase the intensity, try running up hills. [3] X Expert Source Laura Flinn NASM Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview 3. Hop on a rowing machine to get your heart pumping. Rowing is a great all-body workout, and it gets your blood pumping. Plus, rowing often works muscles that your body isn't accustomed to using, which means it can help ramp up your metabolism. 4. Cycle your fat away. Whether you jump on your bike or hit a cycling class at the gym, cycling is also a great way to burn fat. A cycling class can help you increase your intensity to ensure you're burning as much fat as you can, but you may find it easier to incorporate riding a bike into your routine. For instance, you could bike to work instead of taking your car. 5. Swim laps for an all-body workout. Swimming is a great full-body workout, and you can burn up to 750 calories per hour. Try swimming for 30 to 45 minutes 4 or 5 times per week to get the full benefit. If you're just starting out, start out with 10 laps of 50 metres (160 ft) each. You can rest for about half a minute between laps. Add 100 to 200 metres (330 to 660 ft) per week. 6. Row with intensity training. On the rowing machine, row steadily for 20 seconds, and then rest for 10. As you rest, stay on the machine with your legs and arms in place. On the next 20 seconds, try to beat your last 20 seconds. Keep going for 8 rounds of 20 seconds of rowing and 10 seconds of rest. With each round, work on beating your last distance. Finish up by rowing for 500 meters. 7. Sprint using HIIT. As an example of a HIIT routine, you could run and coast at given intervals. For instance, you can run for 40 yards all-out, then slow down for 40 yards. Rest for half a minute and begin again. Alternatively, you can run for 30 seconds and rest for 1 minute and 15 seconds, repeating 10 times. 8. Switch between muscle groups. Typically with interval training, you work hard for a short period and then take a rest. However, another way you can do it is to switch between muscle groups without taking a rest. For instance, focus on an exercise that works your legs and then jump into an exercise that primarily works your arms. For instance, try 30 seconds of pull-ups, doing as many as you can, followed by 60 jumping jacks and 20 burpees, then rest for 30 seconds.",

Interval Cardio (15–25 min, 2–4×/week)\n\n* Pick any modality you like (walk/jog, bike, rower).\n* After 5 min easy, do 8–12 rounds: **1 min hard (RPE 7–8/10)** + **1–2 min easy**.\n* Beginners: brisk walk hills; advanced: short sprints. Consistency beats intensity.\n\n3. Strength + Core Circuit (20–30 min, 2–4×/week)\n   Complete 3 rounds, resting 60–90s between moves:\n\n* Squat or goblet squat — 10–12 reps\n* Hip hinge (dumbbell/kettlebell deadlift) — 10–12\n* Push (push-ups or DB press) — 8–12\n* Pull (rows or pulldowns) — 10–12\n* Core: plank 30–45s or dead bug 8–10/side\n  Progress each week (more reps, weight, or an extra round).\n\n4. Cooldown & Consistency (5–10 min + daily habits)\n\n* Easy stretching and deep breathing.\n* Move daily: aim 7–10k steps. Sleep 7–9h, hydrate.\n* Do Steps 2–3 on **3–5 days/week**. Remember: you **can’t spot-reduce**—fat loss comes from total activity + time.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor the plan to your equipment, fitness level, or schedule.\n",

Place your hands behind your head or across your chest. *   **Step 2:** Exhale and contract your abdominal muscles to lift your head and shoulders off the floor. Hold for a second, then slowly lower back down. Repeat 10-15 times for 3 sets. **2. Russian Twists**\nRussian twists target the obliques and help tighten the waistline.\n*   **Step 1:** Sit on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat, leaning back slightly to engage your core. You can hold a weight or medicine ball for added intensity. *   **Step 2:** Twist your torso to the right, bringing the weight towards the floor beside you. Then twist to the left.

You should be feeling your calf muscles stretch on the downward movement. Repeat this sequence until you feel tired.",

Setup\n\n* Stand on a sturdy step with the **balls of your feet** on the edge and **heels hanging off**.\n* Feet hip-width, toes pointing straight ahead.\n* Lightly hold a wall/rail for balance. **Soft knees**, chest tall, core braced.\n\n2. Lower (stretch)\n\n* **Slowly** drop your heels below the step until you feel a gentle calf stretch.\n* Keep ankles neutral—don’t let them **roll inward** (no “caving”).\n\n3. Raise (drive up)\n\n* Press through the balls of your feet and lift your heels as **high as possible**.\n* Keep weight over the **big toe and second toe**.\n* **Do not bounce**—move smoothly.\n\n4. Peak squeeze\n\n* At the top, **pause 1 second** and squeeze your calves.\n\n5. Lower with control\n\n* Take **~3 seconds** to lower back to just below step height.\n* Maintain posture and ankle alignment. That’s 1 rep.\n* Suggested tempo: **1 up – 1 hold – 3 down**.\n\nProgramming & tips\n\n* **Sets/Reps:** 3 sets of **8–15** controlled reps.\n* **Breathing:** Exhale up, inhale down.\n* **Range:** Go through your full pain-free range; skip deep stretch if it pinches the Achilles.\n* **Progressions:**\n\n  * Make it harder: do **single-leg** calf raises or hold a dumbbell.\n  * Make it easier: reduce range (stop at step height) or keep both hands on support.\n* **Common mistakes:** bouncing, locking knees, letting ankles cave, turning toes out, leaning forward.\n\nIf you’d like the graphic as a printable PDF or with your gym’s colors/logo, I can generate that too.\n\n",

    "prompt": "How to do a face pull with resistance band? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Find a cable pulley machine. The best equipment for a face pull is a cable pulley machine, which should be available at any local gym. A cable pulley machine is a tall piece of exercise equipment with a series of weights attached to an adjustable pulley designed for exercising muscles in your arms and back. It will allow you to easily adjust the size of the weight you’ll be lifting, as well as the height of the pulley mechanism. If you don’t have access to a cable pulley machine, you can use a long resistance band attached to something sturdy a little above the height of your head. This will be less customizable than the cable pulley machine but may be easier to access on a regular basis. 2. Equip the rope attachment. The rope attachment for the cable pulley machine is a short length of rope with a weight on either end and a point to attach it in the middle. Open the carabiner on the machine and clip on the rope attachment. Always take care of the equipment you’re using. If there’s a different attachment already on the machine, make sure to put it back with the other attachments when you equip the rope attachment. 3. Adjust the pulley to be a little above the height of your head. There will normally be a handle or some other mechanism on the side of the pulley rig that you can disengage and engage to adjust the height of the pulley. Shift the pulley so that it is just above the height of your head before locking it in place. 4. Equip a weight around 30 pounds. Face pulls don’t require a heavy weight in order to get the workout you need. Adjust the pin on the weights so that you can easily lift them with only the movement of your arms.The right weight will change from person to person, so start around 30 pounds (14 kg) and add more weight as needed. If you try and do a face pull with too much weight equipped, you’ll end up engaging muscles in your arms and lower back and increase the risk of injury. 5. Grasp one end of the rope in each hand. Firmly grasp the ends of the rope so that the weights on either end face toward you. Take a few steps backward until your arms are fully extended toward the machine. 6. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and your knees bent. Find a firm stance with your knees slightly bent so that you won’t be pulled around by the machine. Lean back around 20 degrees so all of the work is being done by your arms and shoulders rather than your back. If you find this stance difficult to maintain or start feeling pain in your lower back as you exercise, you might need to adjust your stance. Try shifting to a slightly staggered stance with one foot behind the other. 7. Pull the ropes towards your face. Pull the two ropes toward your face, separating your hands and moving them around the side of your head as they get close. Don't raise or pinch the shoulders together—instead, broaden your shoulders as your elbows drive back. [11] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview When holding onto the ropes, rotate your arms at a 90-degree angle. Your elbows should be positioned at shoulder height as you pull the ropes. [12] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview Always keep your elbows high and your wrists above your elbows when pulling the rope backward. Straying too much from this can change the muscles being targeted by the exercise. 8. Reverse the movement and repeat. Hold the ropes on either side of your face for around 1 second, before slowly returning to your initial position by reversing the pulling movement. [14] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview Take about 8 seconds to the control the negative when returning the ropes to the beginning position. [16] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview As face pulls are designed to slowly exercise your muscles with lighter weights, you should do two sets of 20 reps at the end of a back workout. Over time, you may need to add more weight, but you shouldn't need to add more reps or sets. 9. Exercise your rear deltoids and trapezius muscles. Face pulls are designed to work the muscles in and around the shoulder blades, so you should be feeling the exercise here rather than anywhere else. If you are working your biceps or lower back instead, revisit your posture, stance and underhand grip until you feel it in your shoulders. [18] X Expert Source Monica Morris ACE Certified Personal Trainer Expert Interview 10. Move slowly for each rep. It’s more important to move slowly and make sure you are exercising the right muscles than to power through quickly and risk injury. Do a set of around 20 reps slowly, making sure to pull the ropes all way back and fully stretch your rear delts each time. 11. Lean backward rather than forward. As you work through your face pulls, you might feel yourself starting to lean forward while you pull. This might indicate that you have equipped too many weights or are working the wrong muscles. Always make sure you are leaning slightly backward rather than forward. 12. Check that your form is correct. To make sure your form stays correct as you face pull, get a friend or trainer to keep an eye on you and make sure you’re not making any mistakes. You can also set up a camera or leave your phone to record you exercising. You can then review the footage after each set and see where you might be able to revise your form.",

This could be a door frame, a pole, or a piece of gym equipment. Ensure it's stable and won't detach during the exercise.\n**Step 2: Grip the Band**\nStand facing the anchor point, taking a few steps back to create tension in the band. Grip the ends of the band with an overhand grip, palms facing down, or a neutral grip, palms facing each other. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart.\n**Step 3: Initiate the Pull**\nEngage your core and pull the band towards your face. Your elbows should lead the movement, flaring out to the sides and up. Aim to bring your hands to either side of your head, near your ears.\n**Step 4: Squeeze and Hold**\nAt the peak of the movement, squeeze your shoulder blades together and hold for a brief moment. You should feel the contraction in your upper back and rear deltoids.\n**Step 5: Control the Return**\nSlowly and with control, extend your arms back to the starting position, resisting the pull of the band. Do not let the band snap back quickly. Maintain tension throughout the entire movement.\n",

Hover just above the ground, with your thighs hugging close to your calves. As you get more comfortable with this move, you can start from a standing squat. Eventually you will start from a completely standing position. 2. Round your back. Bend your elbows close to your body so that your hands are by your ears. Tuck your head between your arms and curl your back forwards. As you get more comfortable with the position, you can start with your hands extended out in front of you. 3. Roll backwards. When your head hits the mat, tuck your chin and push the ground with your hands. Think about pushing your body away from the mat with your hands. Be sure to keep your shoulders and arms strong and close to your head. They are your point of strength. 4. Swing your legs over your head. Using the momentum of your legs and the strength of your arms, bring your legs over your head and your feet to the mat. You may have to use your core strength as well. Kick your legs to gain momentum, but squeeze your abs to pull your feet to the mat. 5. Stand up. Once your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands, pushing your upper body up to follow your feet. You will be in a squat with your hands on the mat. Stand up from there, with your arms up. In order to practice for your back extension, you can practice ending in a pushup position instead of a standing position. When your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands and use your ab muscles to straighten out into a plank position. Hold that position to build strength.",

Your torso should hinge freely at the hips.\n   * Lock your ankles under the pads with feet flat on the plate, legs straight but knees soft.\n\n2. **Starting position**\n\n   * Body in a straight line from head to heels; ribs stacked over pelvis.\n   * Cross arms over your chest (easiest). Keep neck neutral (gaze ~1–2 m ahead of the floor).\n\n3. **Brace**\n\n   * Inhale through the nose; lightly brace your abs and squeeze your glutes to set a neutral spine.\n\n4. **Lower (the hinge)**\n\n   * Hinge at the hips and **control** the descent. Let the torso tip forward while keeping your back neutral (don’t round).\n   * Stop when you feel a hamstring stretch or when your torso is slightly below parallel. Tempo idea: ~2–3 seconds down.\n\n5. **Pause**\n\n   * Brief 1-second pause at the bottom while staying tight; keep shoulders away from ears.\n\n6. **Raise**\n\n   * Drive your hips into the pad, squeeze glutes/hamstrings, and lift the torso until it’s **in line** with your legs.\n   * Exhale as you come up. Do **not** hyperextend or arch past straight.\n\n7. **Finish & repeat**\n\n   * Hold the top for half a second in neutral, then repeat for 8–12 smooth reps.\n\n**Progressions & variations**\n\n* Easier: hands on hips → arms across chest.\n* Harder: hands behind head → hold a light plate/dumbbell tight to chest.\n* Tempo challenge: 3–4 sec down, 2-sec pause at bottom, 1 sec up.\n* Range: only as deep as you can keep a neutral spine.\n\n**Common mistakes to avoid**\n\n* Rounding the lower back on the way down.\n* Throwing the torso/swinging to get up.\n* Hyperextending at the top (arching past a straight line).\n* Pad set too high (blocks the hips) or too low (digs into thighs).\n* Craning the neck up; keep it neutral.\n\n**Safety tips**\n\n* If you feel sharp pain (especially in the lower back), stop.\n* Keep motion at the **hips**, not by bending the spine.\n* Start with bodyweight and perfect control before adding load.\n\nIf you want, I can also give steps for a **flat-bench alternative** (no Roman chair) or tailor reps/sets to your program.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Lie on your right side with your hips and feet stacked. Extend out straight on the floor, bending your elbow to rest your head on the hand of your lower arm. You can put your upper arm in front of you with your palm flat on the floor for support. If you feel unstable laying this way, bracing the soles of your feet against a wall will help you feel more secure. Another way to increase your stability is to bend your lower knee at a 90-degree angle. Your top leg should still be extended straight out. [3] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source 2. Lift your top leg until you feel your hips begin to tilt. Lift your leg slowly with control as high as you comfortably can without tilting your hips or rolling forward. Keep your body in a straight line and activate your glutes to help you lift your leg. Don't focus on how high you can lift your leg. To work your glutes, you need to keep your hips as straight as possible. If you're rolling forward to lift your leg higher, you're not getting the full benefit. 3. Lower your leg back to starting position. Pause for a second with your leg raised, then slowly lower it back down. Control the movement, resisting the weight of your leg, rather than simply letting it fall. Stopping your foot before you reach your other foot and leaving it hovering in the lower position keeps your glutes activated between reps. 4. Complete 8-10 reps, then switch sides for 1 set. Continue raising and lowering your leg with controlled movements. Make sure you don't start tilting forward or get sloppy with your form. Then roll over to do the same number of reps on the other side. [6] X Trustworthy Source National Health Service (UK) Public healthcare system of the UK Go to source The number of sets you do depends on your overall level of fitness. If you're just starting out, you might only be able to do 1 set. Add another set every couple of weeks to continue to challenge yourself as you get stronger. 5. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, then extend your right leg. Start with good posture, standing straight up with your feet in line with your hips. Point your right toe and slide your foot out to the side until your hips are level. Make sure when you do this you're still standing straight, not leaning over. 6. Raise your right leg to the side as high as you can. Lift your leg out to the side in a slow, controlled movement until you feel the oblique muscle on the side of your torso contract. You'll also feel a nice stretch down the back of your thigh. It's important to keep your torso straight and maintain good posture. If you find it difficult to balance, use a table or the back of a sturdy chair for stability. 7. Return your leg to the starting position. Hold your leg at the highest lift point for a second, then slowly lower it. Control the movement by resisting the weight of your leg rather than simply dropping it to the ground. Keep your toes pointed as you bring your leg back down. If you want to make the exercise a little more difficult, stop when your toes are hovering just above the floor rather than going all the way down to touch the floor. 8. Complete 8-10 reps, then switch sides. Maintain good posture while completing your reps, taking care not to start leaning to the side or tilting your hips. Square up your feet under your hips, point your left toes, and repeat the exercise with your left leg. If you're doing interval training, you can also add side leg raises to your routine, doing as many as you can in 45-60 seconds. Instead of doing all the reps and then switching sides, you can also alternate between sides. Just make sure you're maintaining good form.",

    "text_ref": "1. Keep your back straight and your knees slightly bent. Let your arms hang by your side or bend your elbows like you would if you were jogging. 2. Take deep belly breaths through your nose. It’s important to breathe properly during any sort of exercise. As a rule, it’s best to exhale during the part of the movement where your muscles are doing the most work. [2] X Trustworthy Source Penn State Extension Educational organization dedicated to delivering science-based information to people, businesses, and communities Go to source Breathe in as you get ready to kick, then breathe out when you lift your leg up and back. Breathe in again as you lower your leg. If you have trouble remembering when to breathe, memorize the phrase “Exhale on Exertion.” 3. Bend your knee and swing your foot up and back. Try to touch your heel with your butt. If you can’t quite reach your butt, don’t worry—just get as close as you can! When you’re done, bring your foot back down to the floor. Touch down lightly on the ball of your foot. Keep your hips and shoulders square, and make sure your leg swings straight back instead of out to the side. 4. Kick your other foot up to your opposite glute. Keep switching back and forth between your legs. Stick to a slow, easy pace at first so you can focus on form. 5. Swing your opposite arm forward as you kick up your leg. This will increase the intensity of the exercise a little. Bend your arms 90° at each elbow, just like you would if you were running or jogging. 6. Gradually speed up until you’re at a jog. Do quick alternating steps for 20-60 seconds to get your blood pumping. Don’t forget to pump your arms at the same time! While you’re still learning how to do butt kicks, focus on proper form instead of speed. For example, you might do 20 or 30 reps without worrying about how long it takes to complete the set. As you pick up speed, keep focusing on form. Keep your back straight and your shoulders and hips square. When you’re using butt kicks as part of a dynamic warmup, aim to do them for about a minute before moving on to another stretch or exercise. 7. This will increase the intensity and the fun level. Start out at a jogging pace with your arms bent at your sides. Then, alternate raising your arms to the ceiling and bringing them down to your sides with every kick. Turn on some lively workout music and kick along to the beat! 8. Try this to improve your running posture and technique. Instead of swinging your heel up and around to kick the back of your butt, pull it straight up beneath you. Try to touch the bottom of your butt, where you feel your ischium (or “sit bone”). In this variant, your knee will stick out slightly in front of you as you complete the kick, rather than pointing down at the ground. Focus on letting each foot land softly instead of stomping down hard when you complete the kick. 9. Turn your butt kicks into a dynamic running drill. Instead of standing in one place as you do your kicks, jog forward. As you lift each leg off the ground, bend your knee sharply to kick your heel back toward your glute. Land on the balls of your feet. Running butt kicks are a great way to get more spring in your step and improve the form of your footfalls for better shock absorption. This exercise is also great for strengthening your quadriceps (a group of muscles in the front of your thigh). 10. Butt kicks work best when combined with other warmups. Before you start running or doing any other cardio exercise, spend 5 minutes doing dynamic stretches and exercises, including butt kicks. To target other muscles in your legs and improve your flexibility, try a routine that also includes about 1 minute each of: Rotation running. Jog straight ahead, but twist your torso around to look behind you every 2-3 steps. Walking or jogging backwards. High knees. Bring your knees up toward your chest as you jog forward or in place. Side shuffles. Stand with your shoulders and hips square and move sideways, springing lightly off the balls of your feet. Cariocas. Run sideways while alternately crossing your legs in front of each other.",

    "text_ref": "1. Lie on the floor. To do a hamstring curl on the floor, lie on your stomach with your hands in front of you, slightly wider than your shoulders. 2. Lift your feet. From this position, lift one or both feet off the floor by bending your knees. When doing this, you should be keeping your knees on the floor. Keep your back straight and your knees close together throughout the repetition. 3. Straighten your legs. Release your hamstring by lowering your feet back to the floor. From here, repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions, about 12-15 if you're a beginner. [2] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Fitness Coach Expert Interview 4. Add weight. If these are too easy and you don’t notice the contraction in your hamstrings, add some weight. You can do this by either wrapping ankle weights around your lower legs, or by holding a dumbbell between your feet as you lift them off the ground. 5. Find the machine. The hamstring curl machine will have stacked weights on one side, a flat bench for your body, and a padded cylinder for you to move with your legs. 6. Adjust the lever. Laying on your stomach, the padded cylinder behind you should go on top of your legs. The pad should hit just a few inches below your calf muscles. You can adjust it using the lever until it is in the right spot for your height. 7. Keep your torso flat. Tighten your core muscles to help you keep your torso flat on the bench. Ensure your legs are fully stretched in the starting position, and grab the handles in front of your shoulders to steady yourself. 8. Exhale and curl. As you breathe out, curl your legs up as far as possible without lifting your upper legs off of the bench. Hold for a second once you reach the fully contracted position. If it is too easy or too hard, you can stop and adjust the weight using the stack next to you. 9. Inhale and release. As you breathe in, bring your legs slowly back down to your starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions, or 12-15 if you're a beginner. [6] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Fitness Coach Expert Interview 10. Find a swiss ball. Those are the oversized, light, rubber balls often used for Pilates. It doesn’t matter which size you use. Choose one that you’re comfortable with. You’ll get a bigger contraction with a larger ball. 11. Lay on the floor. With your back on the floor, roll the ball up under your feet. You want your feet to be on the top center of the ball. 12. Lift your hips. Put your full weight between your feet (on the ball) and your shoulder blades. Use your arms to stabilize yourself. This will be your starting position. 13. Bring the ball towards you. Bend your knees, pulling the ball as close as you can to your bottom. This will contract the hamstring. Hold for a brief pause and then push the ball back out to your starting position. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions. Do about 12-15 reps when you're just getting started with hamstring curls. [9] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Fitness Coach Expert Interview",

Adjust\n\n* Seat so your knees align with the machine’s pivot.\n* Backrest supports your lower back.\n* Ankle pad sits just above your heels (low calf).\n\n2. Setup\n\n* Sit tall; ribs down, core braced, hips and back glued to the pad.\n* Feet hip-width; **toes pulled up** (dorsiflex). Grip the handles.\n\n3. Initiate the curl\n\n* Exhale and **drive your heels down and back**.\n* Keep knees pinned to the pad; don’t let hips lift or back arch.\n\n4. Peak squeeze\n\n* Stop when calves near hamstrings (before hips tilt).\n* Hold the squeeze ~1 second; keep toes up.\n\n5. Lower under control\n\n* Inhale and **slowly** return to almost straight legs without locking knees.\n* Aim for ~3–4 seconds on the way down.\n\n6. Finish & repeat\n\n* Re-brace, keep pelvis heavy on the seat, repeat for reps.\n\n**Programming:** 3–4 sets × 8–12 reps (muscle/strength) or 12–15 (accessory). Rest 60–90s.\n**Pro cues:** “Heels to butt,” “toes up,” “ribs down,” “control the return.”\n**Common mistakes:** Hips lifting off seat, arching lower back, letting the pad slam, pointing toes, knees flaring way out.\n**No machine?** Do a **stability-ball ham curl**: bridge hips up, heels on ball, curl it toward glutes, control out.",

    "text_ref": "1. Start on your hands and knees. The starting position for cat pose is also called \"tabletop pose.\" Get on all fours with your wrists directly below your shoulders and your knees directly below your hips. Lay down a yoga mat to lessen the stress on your knees and wrists. Your back should be flat and neutral. Extend your neck out as well, lowering your gaze a bit, so that you can draw a straight, flat line from your head to your tailbone. 2. Spread your fingers. To lessen the stress on your joints, spread your fingers wide and cup your palms slightly. Your middle finger should be facing forward, the rest of your fingers splayed. Press all five fingertips into the mat. If you have problems with your wrists or have had a recent wrist injury, you may want to come down to your elbows. Keep your elbows directly below your shoulders and rest on your forearms instead of your hands. 3. Connect with your breathing. Your breath is a major part of yoga practice. While in tabletop position, take a moment to turn your mental focus to your breath. Inhale deeply through the nose, filling your lungs. Pause, then exhale slowly and deeply out your mouth. 4. Round your back. On an exhale, round your spine up towards the ceiling, keeping your tailbone tucked under. Round your shoulders back so that your shoulder blades fall in line alongside your spine. This position gives the cat pose its name. With your back rounded on all fours, you should look somewhat like an angry cat. 5. Tuck your chin towards your chest. Lengthen your neck to complete cat pose, but don't try to force your chin to touch your chest. Imagine your spine is one long, even curve from your tailbone to your head. Breathe deeply into the curve, gently contracting your glutes. Pull your abdominal muscles back and in towards your spine as you inhale. As you exhale, think of curving and lifting your spine towards the ceiling. Hold the stretch for 5 to 10 breath cycles. 6. Sit back to release. If you're only doing cat pose and not moving into another pose immediately, first lower and flatten your spine to return to tabletop position. Then lower your hips on an exhale to sit back on your heels.",

Start in Tabletop (Neutral)\n\n* Hands under shoulders, knees under hips.\n* Spread fingers; press through palms and knuckles.\n* Spine long and neutral; gaze down between hands.\n* Engage low belly lightly to support your back.\n\n2. Inhale → Cow (Bitilasana)\n\n* Tilt pelvis forward (sit bones lift).\n* Let belly soften toward the mat.\n* Draw chest through the arms; shoulder blades gently squeeze together.\n* Keep neck long; gaze slightly forward (not cranked up).\n\n3. Exhale → Cat (Marjaryasana)\n\n* Press palms; round the entire spine.\n* Tuck tailbone; draw navel toward spine.\n* Broaden across shoulder blades.\n* Let head drop, chin toward chest without jamming.\n\n4. Flow\n\n* Continue to alternate: Inhale to Cow, Exhale to Cat.\n* Move slowly with your breath for 5–10 rounds (or ~1–2 minutes).\n\nTips for Alignment & Comfort\n\n* Keep elbows straight but soft (don’t hyperextend).\n* Distribute weight evenly between hands and knees.\n* If wrists feel tender, come onto fists or place a folded towel under heels of hands.\n* For sensitive knees, add padding under knees or practice on a thicker mat.\n* Neck care: the lift in Cow comes from the upper back/chest, not cranking the head up.\n\nProgressions & Options\n\n* Add small hip circles between Cat and Cow to mobilize the spine.\n* Pause for 2–3 breaths in whichever shape feels best today.\n* To finish, return to neutral or sit back in Child’s Pose for a few breaths.\n\nBreathe easy and move smoothly—quality over range. If you want, I can also generate a print-friendly black-and-white version or separate images for each step.",

    "text_ref": "1. Start with the mountain pose . This pose is also known as the Tadasana Namaskar. Stand up straight and tall with your feet planted firmly on the floor, hip-distance apart. Balance your weight evenly on both feet. Let your hands hang at your sides with the palms facing forward and the fingers open, in a receiving position. Alternatively, you can bring your hands together in front of your chest in a prayer position. Press the tips of your thumbs against your sternum, over your heart chakra. Once you are in the mountain pose, breathe slowly and steadily, and focus on finding your center. 2. Raise your arms in an upward salute (Urdhva Hastasana). Inhale deeply and look upward. Slowly raise your arms above your head with the palms together and your fingers pointing straight upward. Push your hips forward a little so that you enter a slight backbend. Keep your shoulders back and down while you are in this pose. 3. Move into a standing forward bend (Uttanasana). Exhale and bend forward at the hips, keeping your back and legs straight. If you can, bring your chest against your thighs and aim the crown of your head at the floor. Place your hands flat on the floor, or rest them on a block if you cannot reach the floor. Try to line your fingertips up with your toes, with your hands positioned on the outsides of your feet. Keep your back as straight as possible while you are in this pose. Your back should not be rounded. 4. Enter a half-standing forward bend (Ardha Uttanasana). Inhale and slowly slide your hands up along your shins. Raise your head so that you are looking slightly forward and unbend slightly at the hips so that your chest is no longer resting against your thighs. Keep your back flat and straight. Create a triangle between your feet, head, and hips. Alternatively, you can keep your fingertips resting on the floor for this pose. 5. Exhale and return to the forward fold. From the half-standing forward bend, slowly return to your previous position. Slide your hands back down your shins so that you are grasping your ankles. Make sure to keep your back straight as you bend forward and rest your chest against your thighs. 6. Get into a plank pose. Inhale and place your hands flat on the floor. Carefully step back with both feet, one foot at a time, extending your legs straight out behind you with your toes curled under you. Keep your arms straight and your shoulders directly above your wrists, and keep your back straight and flat. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart, and your feet should be hip-distance apart. 7. Lower yourself into a low pushup. This is also known as the 4-limbed staff pose or Chaturanga Dandasana. Exhale and bend your arms at the elbows so that your torso is parallel to the floor. Push back through your legs into your heels, keeping your legs straight out behind you. If you’re not strong enough to do a low pushup, lower yourself down so that your knees, chin, and chest are on the floor. 8. Inhale and enter an upward dog pose (Urdhva Mukha Svanasana). Push your toes out behind you so that the tops of your feet are resting flat on the floor. Keeping your arms straight and your hands resting flat on the floor, raise your head and push your chest forward and your shoulders back so that you enter a backbend. Allow your shins to rest on the floor, but try to keep your thighs and hips slightly elevated. 9. Get into a downward dog pose (Adho Mukha Svanasana). Exhale and roll your feet back onto your toes, keeping your legs straight out behind you. Let your head hang down and move your hips up and back, pushing through your shoulder blades. Keep your hands flat on the floor and your arms straight. Keep your back and legs straight and aim your hips directly at the ceiling. 10. Move back into the standing forward bend. From the downward dog position, inhale and step forward with one foot, then the other. Move your feet so that they are in line with your hands and closer to the front of the mat. Keep your legs and back straight, and bend at the hips. 11. Inhale and move back into the upward salute. Slowly straighten up until you are standing upright, then raise your arms above your head, turning your gaze upward. Keep your hands facing each other or touching, palm to palm. Push your hips forward and your shoulders back so that you enter a slight backbend. Keep your knees very slightly bent during this pose. 12. Exhale and return to the mountain pose. Slowly lower your arms and straighten your back. Let your hands hang at your sides in the forward-facing receptive position, or hold them in front of your chest in the prayer position. Make sure your weight is evenly distributed between both your feet. This will return you to the original pose and bring the Surya Namaskar sequence full circle.",

    "prompt": "How to Do Yoga Walking? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Align your inhales and exhales with each step you take. Be mindful of your breath while walking, like you would be during a regular yoga session. Wear comfortable clothing and footwear to go yoga walking. 2. Do some yoga poses at various intervals along your walk. Part of yoga walking often involves pausing at times to perform a yoga pose (or a few). Start by adding 1 or 2 poses to your walk. As you get more experience, work your way up to a higher number, like 5-7. Incorporating yoga poses into your walk can help with your flexibility and relax your mind. Shoulder and spine rotations: Rotate your shoulders and your spine. Do this to remove any tension in your shoulders and your neck. Gently turn your spine to the right and then to the left several times. Turn your head along with your body. Side body stretch: Extend your arms above your head and touch your palms together. As you walk, reach over to one side, then the other. Standing spinal twist: Standing with your feet hip-width apart, extend your arms parallel to the floor while twisting your torso to one side at waist level. Repeat on the other side. High crescent lunge: While standing with both feet firmly on the ground, lunge one leg forward and extend the other back. While in the low lunge, lift your torso upright, bring your arms overhead, and focus on engaging your core and back leg. Eagle pose using arms: Lift your elbows to shoulder height while touching your palms together. Shift your elbows so one wraps around the other (the corresponding palm is higher as well). Hold for a few seconds and switch your arms to the other side. Standing forward bend: While standing still, hinge forward at the hips to fold your torso. Allow your arms to hang down (or touch the ground if you’re flexible enough). Wide-legged forward fold: Standing with your legs wider than hip-width apart, place your hands on your hips, and fold forward while extending your spine. Your hands can rest on your shins or the ground. 3. Focus on grounding yourself as you walk. Do this by consciously feeling the earth beneath your feet. Think the word \"earth\" while focusing your attention on the soles of your feet. Walters notes that walking yoga “is a very slow, intentional, mindful, meditative walk. Stay aware of how your feet land, along with the vibration of your foot, how it carries throughout the body, to connect to the earth and the breath. You're just letting the body move naturally.” [3] X Expert Source Sandy Walters Yoga Teacher Expert Interview 4. Practice mindfulness and visualization as you walk. Allow yourself to feel negative emotions like anger or sadness, and then do your best to let them go. Focus on a healing color, meditate on a set of numbers, or send out positive vibes to those you care about. Allow these visualizations and yoga meditative practices to help you clear your mind completely. Here are some more specific examples: Release anger by stomping on the ground while you walk. Feel any sadness you’re experiencing and cope with it by walking it off with each step. Perform a mantra while concentrating on a healing color or light; allow it to move down through your body. To relieve tension, imagine the numbers 1 to 20 in your head, chest, abdomen, legs, and feet; energetically send them into the ground (beneath the feet). Send someone positive thoughts that feel as if they’re bathed in light. For 5 minutes during your walk, consciously move all the stress out of you, until your mind becomes calm. 5. Walk freely. Go whichever way you want to. Enjoy your time out in nature, with the knowledge that you’re doing something good for your body, mind, and spirit. Keep your thoughts focused on the positive. According to anxiety and stress management coach Alexandra Janelli, walking in a natural, peaceful environment “gets you into a different headspace.” [4] X Expert Source Alexandra Janelli Anxiety and Stress Management Coach Expert Interview You’re better able to focus within, instead of being overly alert to outside stressors in your daily life.",

Set your intention (30 seconds)\n   Pick a calm, easy pace (about 2–3 out of 10 effort). Decide your focus: “smooth breath,” “soft steps,” or “steady gaze.”\n\n2. Align posture (Mountain-on-the-move)\n   Stand tall first: crown lifted, chin level, shoulders relaxed, ribs easy, pelvis neutral, core lightly engaged.\n\n3. Ground with breath (3 cycles)\n   Breathe slowly through the nose. Feel both feet spread into the ground. Let the exhale be a touch longer than the inhale.\n\n4. Begin walking slowly\n   Roll heel-to-toe with soft knees. Keep strides short and quiet. Imagine you’re “placing” the foot rather than stomping.\n\n5. Sync breath to steps (choose one cadence)\n\n* **4-2-4-2**: Inhale for 4 steps → hold 2 → exhale for 4 → hold 2.\n* **3-3** (gentle): Inhale 3 steps → exhale 3 steps.\n* **4-6** (settling): Inhale 4 → exhale 6.\n  Stay nasal. Optionally use a soft **ujjayi** whisper (slight throat narrowing) if it feels easy.\n\n6. Arm flow\n   Let arms swing naturally beside you. Keep shoulders down and wide; hands unclenched.\n\n7. Drishti (steady gaze)\n   Rest your eyes on the path about 10–15 feet (3–5 m) ahead. Keep peripheral vision soft.\n\n8. Body scan in motion\n   On each loop or minute, check: jaw soft, tongue relaxed, neck long, ribs easy, belly supple, steps quiet.\n\n9. Add a simple mantra (optional)\n   Pair words with steps or breath, e.g., **“In… calm / Out… release”** or **“Here… now.”**\n\n10. Cooldown and close (1–2 minutes)\n    Gradually slow your pace. Let the breath return to natural. Pause standing in Mountain: feel both feet, one full nasal breath in and out.\n\n**Duration:** Start with 5–10 minutes; build to 20+.\n**Where:** Quiet sidewalk, track, or park path.\n**Safety:** If you feel dizzy, short of breath, or uncomfortable, return to normal breathing and pace—or stop and rest.\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor a 2-week progression plan (beginner → intermediate) or adjust the breath cadence for hills or different fitness levels.",

    "Gemini_text": "Yoga walking combines the mindfulness and controlled breathing of yoga with the physical activity of walking. Here's how to do it:\n\n**Step 1: Warm-up and Intention Setting**\nBefore you begin, take a few minutes to stretch lightly. As you walk, bring your awareness to your breath and set an intention for your walk. This could be anything from enjoying nature to releasing stress.\n\n**Step 2: Mindful Breathing**\nCoordinate your breath with your steps. For example, inhale for 3-4 steps and exhale for 3-4 steps. Focus on deep, steady breaths, breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth or nose.\nImage: A serene woman with dark hair stands on a forest path, eyes closed, hands pressed together in a prayer-like gesture. Sunlight streams through the trees in the background. The text \"Step 2: Mindful Breathing\" and \"Coordinate your breath with your steps. Inhale for 3-4 steps, exhale for 3-4 steps.\" are overlaid on the image.\n\n**Step 3: Body Scan**\nAs you walk, regularly scan your body for tension. Start from your head and move down to your toes. If you find tension, consciously relax that area. Notice how your feet connect with the ground, the swing of your arms, and the alignment of your spine.\n\n**Step 4: Walking Meditations (Optional)**\nYou can incorporate short walking meditations. For example, focus on the sensation of your feet touching and lifting from the ground. Alternatively, you can repeat a mantra silently with each step.\nImage: A barefoot woman in a green top and gray leggings walks on a forest path, head held high, eyes looking forward. Sunlight again filters through the tall trees. The text \"Step 4: Walking Meditations (Optional)\" and \"Focus on the sensation of your feet touching and lifting from the ground. Repeat a mantra silently with each step.\" are overlaid on the image.\n\n**Step 5: Cool-down and Reflection**\nTowards the end of your walk, gradually reduce your pace. Find a quiet spot to stand or sit, and take a few moments to reflect on your experience. Notice any shifts in your mood or energy levels.\n\nEnjoy your yoga walking practice!",

Engage + prepare\n\n* Root evenly through all four corners of each foot.\n* Lightly hug thighs toward the midline (imagine holding a block between knees).\n* On a steady inhale, lengthen your tailbone toward your knees to avoid crunching the low back.\n\n3. Lift\n\n* Press feet and upper arms down, then lift hips until thighs are roughly parallel to the floor and shins vertical.\n* Keep knees tracking over ankles (don’t let them splay).

Deepen (optional)\n\n* Roll shoulders slightly underneath you and interlace fingers, or keep palms pressing into the mat.\n* Broaden collarbones and lift the sternum toward the chin without jamming the throat.\n* Keep tailbone long and ribs gently down to maintain length in the lower back.\n\n5. Hold\n\n* Breathe slowly for 5–10 breaths. Keep glutes active but not clenched; most of the lift comes from legs and back body.\n\n6.

Here's how to do it:\n\n1.  **Lie Down:** Begin by lying on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. Your heels should be close enough to your buttocks that you can lightly touch them with your fingertips. Keep your arms by your sides, palms facing down. 2.  **Lift Hips:** Press down through your feet and arms. On an exhale, slowly lift your hips off the mat, engaging your glutes and inner thighs. Your thighs should be parallel, and your knees directly over your ankles. 3.  **Clasp Hands (Optional):** If comfortable, you can shimmy your shoulders underneath you and clasp your hands together beneath your back. Press your clasped hands into the mat to help lift your chest further. Keep your gaze directed upwards or at your nose to maintain a neutral neck. 4.  **Hold and Release:** Hold the pose for 30 seconds to a minute, breathing deeply. To release, unclasp your hands if you had them clasped, and slowly roll your spine back down to the mat, one vertebra at a time, until your hips rest on the floor. You can hug your knees to your chest to release your lower back if desired. ",

    "text_ref": "1. Start with a low weight. The most important thing with squats is to have the correct form, so you shouldn't attempt weighted squats until you can perform body weight squats with perfect form. Start with a low weight — maybe just using the bar (which weighs 45lbs) — and slowly build yourself up to heavier weights as your squat technique and muscle strength improves. 2. Position the bar correctly. Set up the squat rack so the bar is slightly below shoulder level. Position the safety bars so they are low enough to allow you to squat down fully with the bar on your shoulders. When you're ready, duck under the bar and grip it widely with your palms facing forward. Rest the bar across your upper back (not your neck). If this feels uncomfortable for you, try using a bar pad. 3. Squat using the same technique as the body weight squat. Place your feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with your toes pointing slightly outwards. Hinge your hips and push your butt backwards until your hamstrings are parallel with the floor. Keep your chest up, your shoulders back and your eyes looking straight ahead. Remember to keep your back straight — this is especially important when you are squatting with heavy weights. Push out of the squat with your heels and don't let your knees cave in towards the center. If this happens, you may need to reduce your weight. 4. Inhale on the way down, exhale on the way back up. Breathing deeply is very important when squatting heavy weights. If you hold your breath you can become dizzy, nauseous or even blackout. Take a deep breath in as you squat down and exhale powerfully as you rise up. Maintaining this breathing pattern will give you the energy you need to keep going. If you're pushing yourself to get another few repetitions, don't be afraid to pause between repetitions to take a couple of deep breaths.",

Set J-cups & safeties → 2) Load bar & collars → 3) Unrack & walkout → 4) Stance & brace → 5) Descend → 6) Bottom position & depth → 7) Drive up → 8) Re-rack, plus a “Common mistakes” box (knees caving, heels lifting, bar drifting forward, excessive arch/round).\n\n# Text steps (detailed)\n\n1. Rack setup\n\n* Set J-cups around mid-chest so the bar is ~1–2 in (2–5 cm) below shoulder height.\n* Set safety pins just below your expected bottom depth (they should catch the bar if you fail without touching it during good reps).\n\n2. Load & secure\n\n* Load plates evenly and add collars. Clear the area behind you.\n\n3. Bar position & grip\n\n* Walk under the bar. Place it across the upper traps (high-bar) or slightly lower on the rear delts (low-bar)—choose one and keep it consistent.\n* Hands just outside shoulder width, squeeze the bar, wrists neutral (not bent back), elbows angled down/back to lock the upper back.\n\n4. Stance & bracing\n\n* Step under the bar with feet under hips, stand tall to unrack.\n* Take 1–2 controlled steps back.\n* Set feet shoulder-width (give or take), toes turned out ~10–30°.\n* Big breath into your belly and sides, brace your core 360°, ribs stacked over pelvis.\n\n5. The descent\n\n* Keep the bar over your mid-foot.\n* Break at hips and knees together; let the knees track over your toes (not collapsing inward).\n* Maintain a neutral spine and steady gaze (chin tucked, eyes forward).\n\n6. Bottom position & depth\n\n* Aim for hip crease at or just below the top of the knee (or the deepest pain-free, controlled range you can maintain).\n* Shins roughly forward, whole foot glued to the floor, weight mid-foot to heel.\n\n7. The ascent\n\n* Drive the floor away, push up through mid-foot/heels.\n* Keep knees tracking over toes and chest tall; think “stand up with the bar” and “drive hips and chest together.”\n* Exhale through the sticking point or finish the rep, then reset your breath between reps.\n\n8. Re-rack safely\n\n* Step forward until both sides touch the uprights, then sit the bar straight down into the J-cups.\n* Don’t let go until you’re sure it’s seated.\n\n9. Safety & spotting tips\n\n* Warm up with the empty bar, then small jumps.\n* Shoes with firm, flat or lifting soles improve stability.\n* Use a spotter for heavy sets (they should follow your torso and assist only if the bar stalls).\n* If you must bail alone: drop to the safeties by sitting back/soft knees and letting the bar settle on the pins—then step forward out.\n\n10. Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Knees caving in hard.\n* Heels lifting or rocking to toes.\n* Bar drifting forward of mid-foot.\n* Over-arching or rounding the back.\n* Rushing the walkout (take only 1–2 steps).\n\n11. Simple programming starter\n\n* 3–5 sets × 3–8 reps, leaving 1–3 reps in reserve. Rest 2–4 minutes.\n\nWant a version tailored to front squats or low-bar specifics?

    "text_ref": "1. Find a step, bench, or box that’s about knee height. Use a stable object to prop up your foot so you’re able to perform the movement safely. Choose a step, bench, box, chair, or any other stable object with a flat surface. Make sure the object isn’t higher than your knee level. If you’re at a gym, look for a weight bench to use. Using an object higher than your knee level won’t allow you to perform the movement properly and could potentially cause an injury. 2. Stand 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) away from the object in a lunge position. Take a staggered stance in front of the object. Place 1 foot forward so it’s about 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) away from the box, bench, chair, or whatever stable object you’re using. The closer your foot is to the object, the more you’ll activate your quads or thigh muscles. Move your foot a little further away to activate your glutes, a.k.a. your booty, more. 3. Place your rear foot on the step, bench, or box. Standing in a staggered lunch position, take your rear foot and prop it up on top of your object. You can place your rear foot flat or on its toes, so choose the most comfortable position for you. Whichever position you choose, make sure you feel balanced and comfortable. 4. Lower your hips down until your front thigh is almost horizontal. Bend your front knee and lower your hips down to the floor. Keep your front knee in line with your foot and don’t it move past your toes as you lower down to keep your body in alignment. Continue lowering down until the thigh of your front leg is nearly parallel to the floor.Avoid leaning forward as you lower down so you don’t get off-balanced. If it helps improve your balance, extend your arms out in front of you. Otherwise, you can keep them loose at your sides or place your hands on your hips. 5. Allow your back knee to bend as you lower down. Keep your foot propped up on the stable object and maintain your balance. Let your rear knee naturally bend as you lower yourself down until your front thigh is almost horizontal. Your back knee may make light contact with the floor. 6. Return to the starting position by pushing through your front foot. Once you lower down, drive up through the heel of your front foot. Continue pushing until you return to the position that you started in. After you work 1 leg, switch your stance and workout your other leg. Aim for 3 sets of 12-15 repetitions on each leg to get a great Bulgarian split squat workout. If you’re just starting out with the movement, you can place a small pad on the ground to protect your rear knee from impact.",

Here's a breakdown of how to perform them effectively and some tips to maximize your results.\n\n**Step 1: Set Up Your Stance**\n\nStart by standing about two to three feet in front of a bench or elevated surface. Place the top of one foot (your non-working leg) on the bench behind you. Your front foot should be far enough forward that your knee doesn't extend past your toes when you squat down. Your working leg should be directly under your hip. **Step 2: Descend into the Squat**\n\nKeeping your chest up and core engaged, slowly lower your body by bending your front knee. Descend until your front thigh is parallel to the floor, or slightly below. Your back knee should nearly touch the ground. Focus on driving your weight through the heel of your front foot. **Step 3: Drive Up**\n\nPush through the heel of your front foot to return to the starting position. Squeeze your glute at the top. Control the movement and avoid using momentum. **Step 4: Repeat and Switch Sides**\n\nComplete your desired number of repetitions on one leg, then switch to the other leg. Aim for 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions per leg to build muscle. ",

    "text_ref": "1. Start in a spot where you have a clear path in front of you. You need space to do walking lunges because you’ll be traveling across the floor. Choose a spot where you have at least 15 to 20 feet (4.6 to 6.1 m) of walking space. If you’re doing walking lunges at home, your hallway or your living room may provide enough space. You can do walking lunges indoors or outdoors, but you may have more space if you go outside or to a gym. 2. Stand up straight with your legs hip-width apart and core engaged. Keep your back straight throughout the exercise. Additionally, lift your chin so that your head is facing forward, and don’t lock your knees at any point. Focusing on your core muscles will help you give them a better workout. Make sure they stay engaged. 3. Position your hands at your hips or behind your head for stability. Your arms can help you keep your balance as you do your lunges. Choose whichever position is most comfortable for you. If you’re not sure which position to use, try them both to see which one feels more comfortable. 4. Take a wide step about 2 feet (0.61 m) forward with your right leg. Lift your right leg and move it out in front of you. Land on your heel and roll your foot down onto the floor. Make sure you’re taking wide steps, as small steps won’t give you enough space to bend your knees correctly. You don’t want your front knee sliding out in front of your toes, which can happen if you take short steps. 5. Lower your body until both knees are at a 90-degree angle. Your front leg should be in-line with your ankle, and your back leg should hover about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) off the floor. [2] X Expert Source Francisco Gomez Fitness Coach Expert Interview Don’t let your front knee go past your ankle or let your back knee touch the floor. The top of your front thigh will be parallel to the floor. 6. Push off of your back (left) foot to rise out of the lunge. Lift your leg off of the floor and bring it forward. Use your front (right) leg to help pull yourself forward while maintaining your balance. You can vary your speed as you do your walking lunges. At first, do them slowly so you can focus on your form. Later, you can speed up. 7. Bring your back (left) foot forward to step into another lunge. Now, your left leg should be the front leg. Land on your heel, then roll your foot down onto the floor. Lower your body so that your knees are at 90-degree angles. To rise out of the lunge, push off with your right (back) foot. 8. Continue lunging forward until you run out of space. Alternate legs with each step to continue moving forward. After you reach the end of your pathway, turn around and lunge back to your starting point. As an alternative, you can count your reps. You can also do laps with walking lunges to really increase your workout. For example, lunge around the block or do laps at a local track.",

Start tall\n\n* Feet hip-width (not heel-to-toe).\n* Brace your core; shoulders down/back; gaze forward. Hands on hips or by your sides.\n\n2. Step and plant\n\n* Step forward ~2–3 foot lengths with the right foot.\n* Land heel → whole foot; keep feet on “two rails” (still hip-width).\n\n3. Lower into the lunge\n\n* Drop straight down until the front thigh is about parallel to the floor.\n* Front knee tracks over the middle of the foot (don’t cave inward).\n* Back knee bends and hovers 1–2 inches off the floor; back heel stays lifted.\n* Torso stays upright; ribs stacked over hips.\n\n4. Drive up and through\n\n* Press through the whole front foot (especially mid-foot/heel).\n* Stand up, bringing your back (left) foot forward to meet or slightly pass the right.\n\n5. Reset your base\n\n* Pause briefly with feet hip-width and balance steady.\n* Re-brace your core.\n\n6. Repeat on the other leg\n\n* Step forward with the left foot and repeat, walking forward for distance or reps.\n\n### Breathing\n\n* Inhale as you lower; exhale as you drive up and through.\n\n### Common form cues (quick checklist)\n\n* “Knee tracks over mid-foot.”\n* “Back knee hovers, don’t slam the floor.”\n* “Tall torso, neutral spine.”\n* “Feet stay hip-width—don’t walk a tightrope.”\n\n### Avoid these mistakes\n\n* Front knee collapsing inward.\n* Tiny steps that jam the knee, or huge steps that pull you into a back arch.\n* Leaning the torso far forward or over-arching the low back.\n* Pushing only from the toes—use the whole foot.\n\n### Scaling & variations\n\n* Easier: reverse lunges; split squats (in-place); light support from a wall/rail.\n* Harder: goblet walking lunges (hold a dumbbell/kettlebell), suitcase carry, overhead, or slow 3–4 sec descents.\n\n### Programming ideas\n\n* 2–3 sets of 8–12 steps per leg, or 10–20 meters per set.\n* Rest 60–90 sec between sets. Warm up hips/ankles first.\n\n### Safety note\n\n* You should feel your quads/glutes working, not sharp knee pain. If pain appears, stop and regress the variation or consult a qualified professional.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Lie on your back on top of an exercise mat . Find a comfortable spot to lie down on the floor where you can spread out. Keep your neck and back in line. Tighten your abs and push your lower back flat against the mat the entire time you’re performing crunches to ensure your core stays engaged. If you don’t have an exercise mat, then lay out a soft towel or do crunches on a carpeted floor so you’re more comfortable. 2. Bend your knees so your feet are flat on the floor. Position your feet so your heels are about 12 to 18 in (30 to 46 cm) from your tailbone. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and keep them about hip-width apart. Make sure the soles of your feet are flat against the ground. 3. Cross your arms in front of your chest with your hands just below your shoulders. Keep your elbows pointed down toward your feet. Lay your hands flat on your chest right in front of your shoulders. Avoid putting your hands behind your head since you could accidentally strain your neck when you perform your exercise. For more resistance during your workout, hold a 5 to 10 pounds (2.3 to 4.5 kg) plate weight over your chest. 4. Lift your shoulder blades off of the mat with a smooth, controlled motion. Tighten your abs and take a deep breath in. As you exhale, engage your muscles to raise your torso off of the mat all while keeping your lower back and feet flat on the floor. Lift yourself just enough to get your shoulder blades off of the floor. Support yourself in this position for 1–2 seconds. Avoid sitting all the way up when you perform a crunch since muscles in your back and hips will take over, and you could strain yourself. Keep your lower back, tailbone, and feet in contact with the mat at all times. If your feet lift off of the ground while you’re performing a rep, have someone hold onto your feet or position them underneath something heavy. Keep your neck relaxed instead of tucking in your chin. Try to keep an apple-sized space between your chin and your chest. Looking at the ceiling can help keep you from curling your neck too much. 5. Lower yourself back down with a slow, steady motion. Gently inhale as you slowly lower your torso down to the floor. Use a smooth, controlled motion to work your ab muscles and prevent you from injuring yourself. Take a brief pause to finish 1 rep. If you rush into the next rep, you’ll end up using the momentum of your body moving instead of your muscles to lift yourself up. Additionally, you’re more likely to injure your back Try doing a set of 10–12 crunches to start working out your abs . As you start building up your core strength, try doing 2–3 sets or increasing the number of reps you do.",

Brace\n\n* Take a breath in.\n* Gently **brace your core** as if preparing for a light poke, keeping hips stacked and elbow open.\n\n3. Crunch up\n\n* **Exhale** and bring your **left ribcage toward your left hip**.\n* Lift both shoulders a few inches; keep elbow wide and gaze forward.\n* Knees and legs stay quiet—movement comes from your **obliques**, not from tugging the head.\n\n4. Pause\n\n* Hold the top position for **1 second**, keep breathing softly, feel the side squeeze.\n\n5. Lower with control\n\n* **Inhale** and lower your shoulders back to the start without collapsing. Maintain tension.\n\n6. Repeat & switch sides\n\n* Do **8–15 controlled reps**, then **flip to your left side** to work the right obliques.\n* Aim for **2–3 sets per side**.\n\n### Form tips & common mistakes\n\n* Keep hips stacked; don’t roll backward.\n* Don’t yank on your head—your hand just supports.\n* Small range is fine; prioritize **slow, controlled** reps.\n* If you feel your neck more than your side, reduce range and press your tongue lightly to the roof of your mouth to help stabilize.\n\n### Make it easier\n\n* Place top hand across your chest instead of behind your head.\n* Keep bottom arm straight and use it lightly on the floor for balance.\n\n### Make it harder\n\n* Straighten your legs and keep feet slightly off the floor.\n* Add a light dumbbell or small plate held against the side of your ribcage (still no neck pulling).\n\nIf you want variations (e.g., **side plank crunch** or **standing side crunch**), say the word and I’ll add those too.\n",

Your feet should be flat on the floor and your legs should be bent at the knees. If you're on a bench, your head should be at one end of the bench so you have space to use your weights. On a stability ball, just balance in the middle of your back. 2. Hold weights straight out in front of you. Start with basic weights, such as dumbbells. If you haven't done this exercise before, start small, such as with 5-lb (2.3 kg) weights. Hold the weights straight out from your chest. Your wrists should face inwards. 3. Lower the weights towards the floor by bending your elbows. Slowly bend your elbows, lowering the weights down towards your face. Keep your upper arms perpendicular to the floor, while your forearms move. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview It can be hard at first, so just do your best. Some people start in this position instead of with their arms straight. How you begin is up to you. 4. Move back to the starting position. Slowly bring your arms back up to a straightened position. Repeat the movement for a total of 12 reps. You can do another set or move on to another exercise. You can also work up to more sets over time.",

Don’t let elbows flare; keep wrists straight. Stop just shy of a hard lockout.\n\n4. **Finish & Repeat**\n   Re-brace your core and keep shoulder blades pinned to the bench. Repeat for controlled reps (e.g., 8–12). Rack the bar carefully when done.\n\n**Quick cues:** elbows in, wrists neutral, bar travels slightly back toward hairline, move only at elbows.\n**Safety:** start light, use collars, and consider a spotter.

[1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview Bring your arms down along your sides and rest your palms on your chair, wrapping your fingers under the front of the seat. Straighten your legs out in front of you and place your heels firmly on the ground. Your seat should be stable enough that it doesn’t topple forward while you work. A workout bench is ideal if you have access to one. If you don't have a chair or bench, the edge of your bed will work too. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 2. Scoot your buttocks off the chair, supporting yourself with your hands. Driving your weight into the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet, move your bottom forward until it’s completely off the chair. Keep your elbows tucked behind you, your shoulder blades back and down, and your forearms perpendicular to the floor. Position your hands so that your fingers are facing forward rather than out to the side. 3. Lower yourself by bending your elbows back until they reach a 90-degree angle. Engage your triceps as you dip down so that your lowering motion is slow and controlled. Keep your elbows tucked straight back behind you instead of letting them flare out to get the best control for this exercise. Don’t let your bottom touch the floor. If you can’t get down to a 90-degree angle to start, that’s perfectly normal. It’s better to not dip all the way to 90-degrees than to dip too far too fast. 4. Straighten your elbows fully to lift yourself back up. Pause for 1-2 seconds at the bottom of your dip to make sure your motions are in-control. Then, engage your triceps to press your body back up, bringing your arms straight. Straighten your arm completely at the top of the move. 5. Repeat 5-7 times. If you are a beginner, start by building your strength rather than going all-out with tricep dips. Start your routine with 5-7 dips per set. Once you feel like you can safely and comfortably complete that, gradually increase the number of dips you do by 1 or 2 at a time.",

Keep upper arms still and elbows tucked ~20–30°. Bend only at the elbows to lower the bar toward your forehead or just behind your hairline on a 2–3-second count.\n\n3. **Press**\n   Exhale as you extend the elbows to drive the bar back to the start. Don’t let elbows flare; keep wrists straight. Stop just shy of a hard lockout.\n\n4. **Finish & Repeat**\n   Re-brace your core and keep shoulder blades pinned to the bench. Repeat for controlled reps (e.g., 8–12). Rack the bar carefully when done.\n\n**Quick cues:** elbows in, wrists neutral, bar travels slightly back toward hairline, move only at elbows.\n**Safety:** start light, use collars, and consider a spotter.

Here's how to do them:\n\n**Step 1: Set Up Your Station**\nFind a stable surface that can support your weight, such as parallel bars, a sturdy chair, a bench, or the edge of a sturdy table. Ensure it won't slip or tip over.\n\n**Step 2: Position Your Body**\nSit on the edge of your chosen surface and place your hands shoulder-width apart next to your hips, fingers pointing forward or slightly out. Extend your legs in front of you, either bent at the knees (easier) or straight (harder).\n\n**Step 3: Lift Off**\nPush up through your hands to lift your glutes off the surface. Your arms should be almost fully extended, with a slight bend in your elbows to avoid locking them out.\n\n**Step 4: Lower Your Body**\nSlowly bend your elbows, lowering your body straight down towards the floor. Keep your back close to the bench. Go down until your elbows are at about a 90-degree angle, or until you feel a good stretch in your chest and triceps. Ensure your shoulders don't shrug up towards your ears.\n\n**Step 5: Push Up**\nPush through your hands and extend your elbows to lift your body back up to the starting position. Focus on squeezing your triceps at the top of the movement.\n\n",

Choose cable height based on focus:\n\n   * **Midline (classic):** pulleys around chest/shoulder height.\n   * **High-to-Low:** pulleys set high to bias lower chest.\n   * **Low-to-High:** pulleys set low to bias upper chest.\n3. Select a light-to-moderate weight that you can control for 10–15 reps.\n\n## Body Position\n\n4. Stand in the middle, grab each handle, and **step forward** to create tension.\n5. **Stagger your stance** (one foot slightly forward), knees soft, torso tall.\n6. **Shoulders down and back**, ribs gently up; brace your core.\n7. Start with arms open in a wide “T”, **elbows slightly bent** (keep that bend the whole time).\n\n## Movement (One Rep)\n\n8. **Exhale and sweep** the hands on a smooth **arc** toward each other—like hugging a big tree.\n9. Bring the handles together **in front of your lower chest** (for midline). Wrists neutral; don’t let elbows lock.\n10. **Squeeze the chest** for 1–2 seconds.\n11. **Inhale and return** along the same arc until you feel a stretch across the chest; stop before shoulders roll forward.\n12. Repeat for target reps.\n\n## Breathing & Tempo\n\n* **Exhale** on the sweep in; **inhale** on the return.\n* Use a **2–1–3** tempo: ~2s in, 1s squeeze, ~3s return.\n\n## Sets & Reps (General)\n\n* Hypertrophy: **3–4 sets × 10–15 reps**\n* Finisher/pump: **2–3 sets × 15–20 reps** (lighter)\n* Rest: **45–75 seconds** between sets.\n\n## Variations\n\n* **High-to-Low:** Start high, finish around navel/hip line (slight forward torso).\n* **Low-to-High:** Start low, finish around upper-chest/face line (upright torso).\n* **Single-Arm:** Great for focus and ironing out imbalances.\n\n## Form Cues\n\n* “Chest up, shoulders down.”\n* “Arms are levers; **move from the shoulder**, not the elbows.”\n* “Draw **arcs**, don’t press straight out.”\n* “Stop just before the weights stack touches.”\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n* Shrugging or letting shoulders roll forward.\n* Locking or pumping the elbows.\n* Leaning too far or bouncing.\n* Letting the handles slam together or the stack crash.\n\n## Safety\n\n* If you feel shoulder pain (sharp or pinchy), reduce range, lower the weight, or switch to a neutral grip.\n* Warm up with light flyes or band pull-aparts first.\n* This is general fitness guidance—consult a pro if you have injuries or concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Visual steps:** See the generated infographic above. If you’d like, I can also output separate images for each step (setup, stance, start, movement, squeeze, return) or tailor the visuals to your cable height preference.\n",

Here's how to perform it:\n\n**Step 1: Set Up the Machine**\nAdjust the pulleys on a cable crossover machine to your desired height. For targeting the middle chest, set them at shoulder height. For the upper chest, set them lower, and for the lower chest, set them higher. Select an appropriate weight that allows you to maintain good form for 10-15 repetitions.\n**Step 2: Grab the Handles**\nStand in the middle of the machine with a slight forward lean. Grab one handle with each hand, palms facing forward or slightly inward. Your arms should be extended out to the sides with a slight bend in your elbows.\n**Step 3: Perform the Crossover**\nKeeping the slight bend in your elbows constant, bring the handles together in an arc motion in front of your body. Focus on squeezing your chest muscles as you do this. Your hands should meet around the midline of your chest. Exhale as you bring the handles together.\n**Step 4: Return to the Start**\nSlowly and in a controlled manner, reverse the movement to return to the starting position. Allow your chest muscles to stretch, but don't let the weights touch the stack. Inhale as you return to the start.\n",

Setup\n\n* Choose a light–moderate pair of dumbbells and a flat bench.\n* Sit with bells on thighs, lie back, and “kick” them to your chest as you settle.\n\n2. Starting position\n\n* Feet flat, glutes on bench, neutral spine (small natural arch).\n* Retract and depress your shoulder blades (down and back).\n* Press bells up over mid-chest, palms facing each other.\n* Soften elbows ~10–20° (keep that angle the whole time). Wrists stacked over elbows.\n\n3. Lower (eccentric)\n\n* Inhale. Open the arms in a wide **arc**, not a press.\n* Keep the elbow bend **constant**; shoulders stay down away from ears.\n* Lower until elbows are roughly level with the bench and you feel a light chest stretch—no shoulder pinch.\n\n4. Bottom position (brief pause)\n\n* Pause 0–1s with control. Chest open, rib cage quiet (don’t flare).\n* Elbows slightly below hands; wrists straight.\n\n5. Raise (concentric)\n\n* Exhale. Squeeze your pecs to bring the bells back up in the **same arc**.\n* Stop with bells over chest; no need to clang them together.\n\n6. Repeat & programming\n\n* Tempo: 2–3s down, 1–2s up.\n* Sets/Reps: 2–4 sets of 8–12 reps for hypertrophy (lighter weight to learn). Rest 60–90s.\n\n### Form tips\n\n* Think “hug a big tree” to keep the arc and constant elbow angle.\n* Keep shoulder blades pinned to the bench.\n* If shoulders feel strained, reduce range or switch to a floor fly or cables.\n\n### Common mistakes\n\n* Turning it into a **press** (bending/straightening elbows).\n* Lowering too deep and yanking on the shoulders.\n* Shrugging, flaring ribs, or arching hard off the bench.\n* Using weights so heavy you lose control.\n\n### Variations (optional)\n\n* **Incline fly** (targets upper chest).\n* **Floor fly** (safer range).\n* **One-and-a-half reps** (extra time under tension).\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a version for **incline** or **floor** fly visuals.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Lie on a flat bench. Lie on your back on a flat weight bench with your legs at either side. Your knees should be at right angles with your feet flat on the floor. Adjust your lower back so that your spine is neutral, your shoulder blades pressed down on either side of your spine. Hold the dumbbells on your thighs to start. If this is your first time doing this exercise, use fairly light weights to start. As you move to heavier weights, get a friend to spot you. Instead of resting the weights on your thighs to start, have your friend hand you the weights once you get into position. 2. Raise the dumbbells to your sides. Lift the dumbbells one at a time and hold them in front of your body at shoulder-width, just to the sides of your chest. Your elbows should be at right angles with your forearms perpendicular to your body. This is the starting position for the exercise. Maintain control of the weight. If the dumbbell is shaky or wobbly and you have difficulty controlling it, go with a lighter weight. 3. Press the dumbbells up as you exhale. Extend your arms and press the dumbbells straight up, using your chest muscles. When your arms are fully extended, straighten your elbows and squeeze your chest muscles so that the ends of the dumbbells are touching each other. Squeeze and hold at the top of the press for a second before lowering the weights back down. 4. Lower the dumbbells slowly on an inhale. Lower the weights back to the starting position, so that your elbows are at a 90-degree angle. Move slowly, taking about twice as long to lower the weights as you did to press them. With proper form, you should feel your chest muscles doing most of the work. If you feel strain in your shoulders, stop and check your form. Make sure your shoulder blades are tucked in along the length of your spine and your shoulders are flat, not crunched. Be particularly careful not to lower the weights too far. This can cause shoulder injuries, including torn tendons and ligaments. 5. Repeat as necessary for your training goals. The number of dumbbell presses you do will depend on whether you're training for muscle growth, strength, or endurance. Generally, do higher reps with lighter weights for endurance. Do lower reps with heavier weights for strength. For example, if you're training for increased muscle strength, you might do 1 to 5 reps of the largest weight you can press for that number of reps. If you're training for overall toning and fitness, use a lighter weight and do 10-15 reps.",

Hinge at the hips, **neutral spine**, and deadlift them to standing.\n3. **Starting stance:** feet hip-width, knees soft, arms straight at your sides, palms facing in (neutral grip), ribs down, neck long, eyes forward.\n\n**Execution**\n4) **Brace** (light core tension).\n5) **Shrug straight up:** slide your shoulder blades **up** (and slightly back), bringing your shoulders toward your ears. **Do not bend your elbows** and don’t roll your shoulders.\n6) **Pause** at the top for 1 second—grow tall.\n7) **Lower slowly** until your shoulders are fully **down and back** (depressed). Feel a gentle stretch at the bottom.\n\n**Tempo & Breathing**\n8) Tempo: **1 second up, 2–3 seconds down.**\n9) Breathing: inhale to brace, **exhale gently as you lift**, inhale on the way down.\n\n**Reps & Sets**\n10) Do **2–4 sets of 8–15 reps.** Rest 60–90 seconds. Pick a load that keeps your neck relaxed and form crisp.\n\n**Form checkpoints (quick cues)**\n\n* “**Ears to shoulders, not elbows to ribs.**”\n* “**Arms long, wrists neutral.**”\n* “**Don’t roll** the shoulders forward.”\n* “**Tall neck**—no chin jutting.”\n* Bells stay near your thighs; torso doesn’t sway.\n\n**Common mistakes to avoid**\n\n* Bending the elbows or turning it into a curl.\n* Letting the ribs flare or leaning back.\n* Jerking/bouncing the weight; losing control on the way down.\n* Rolling the shoulders in circles.\n\n**Variations**\n\n* **Single-arm suitcase shrug:** one kettlebell; keep hips level—great for anti-lean stability.\n* **Paused top shrug:** 2–3-sec hold at the top.\n* **Heavier, low-rep sets (6–10)** once form is solid.\n\n**Warm-up idea (quick)**\n\n* 30–60s light band pull-apart holds + 10 scapular wall slides, then a light set of shrugs to groove the motion.\n\n> Tip: If you feel neck strain, reduce load, shorten range, and emphasize “shoulders down” between reps.

    "text_ref": "1. Grip the bar with your hands shoulder-width apart using an overhand grip. Lift your arms straight over your head with your palms facing forward. Keep your arms in line with your shoulders to maintain good form. Then, wrap your hands around the bar in an overhand grip. Use a bench or sturdy chair to reach the bar, if necessary. An underhand grip, which is when your palms face backward, can strain your arms and shoulders. Always use an overhand grip with this exercise. Try using chalk if your hands get sweaty while you’re working out. You don’t want to accidentally slip off the pull-up bar! 2. Keep your legs straight and your feet together. Extend your legs so that they’re completely straight and hold the insides of your feet together. Position your feet so that the soles of your shoes are parallel to the floor. Before lifting your legs, check that your body is hanging in a straight line from your hands down to your feet. Don’t swing back and forth while you’re doing your hanging leg raises. 3. Tighten your core as you lift your legs, keeping your knees straight. Use your core and leg muscles to control your movement. Hinge at your waist and slowly raise your legs out in front of you. Keep your legs as straight as possible with your feet pressed together. Don’t swing your body to gain momentum. All the movement should come through your core and your legs. When you’re just starting out, you may not be able to raise your legs very high, and that is okay! 4. Stop raising your legs when your thighs and feet are above your hips. Lift your legs as high as you can without feeling discomfort. Ideally, raise your legs so that the tops of your thighs are higher than your hips. Then, pause for 3 to 5 seconds to work your abs. If you can’t raise your legs very high, keep working at it. You will see improvements! Don’t tense your shoulders as you lift your legs because it might cause discomfort in your neck. 5. Lower your legs slowly back to the starting position. Keep your core and thigh muscles engaged as you lower your legs. Use a slow, controlled motion to safely return to your starting position. Dropping your legs too fast can hurt your back. 6. Work your way up to 3 sets of 15 reps. Listen to your body and go at your own pace. Lift your legs as high as you can while maintaining proper form. Similarly, do as many reps as you can with proper form if you can't do 15. Focus on getting incrementally better each time you work out. Keep working until you can do 3 sets of 15 reps. Rest for 1 minute between sets. If you can’t get your legs very high, try to move them up another 1 in (2.5 cm) each day. If you can only do a few repetitions, work on adding an additional rep every week.",

Hands shoulder-width, overhand grip; elbows slightly bent, shoulders packed (down & back).\n\n2. **Knees Up**\n   Tuck knees high to bring feet to the rope while keeping arms tight (don’t pull yourself up yet).\n\n3. **Wrap (J-Hook)**\n   Sweep the rope from **outside → inside** under your dominant foot so it runs over the top of that shoe.\n\n4. **Pinch**\n   Place the other foot on top of the rope (heel on dominant foot’s toes) and **pinch** hard—this locks the rope.\n\n5. **Stand Tall**\n   Drive through your legs to stand up. Hips extend; keep the rope close to your body. This saves your arms.\n\n6. **Slide Hands Up**\n   Once tall and stable, slide both hands up the rope one at a time to a new high position; re-pack your shoulders.\n\n7. **Re-Tuck & Re-Lock**\n   Lift knees again, re-wrap if needed, **re-pinch** the feet, and repeat the stand–slide cycle.\n\n8. **Descent (Controlled)**\n   Reverse the process: lower by bending knees/hips while maintaining the foot pinch. Slide hands down in short moves. Avoid fast sliding on bare skin.\n\n9. **Finish**\n   Step onto the mat with soft knees. Shake out arms and do a light forearm/lat stretch.\n\n## Optional: S-Hook Foot Lock (Alternative)\n\n* Wrap rope **around the outside of the dominant leg**, then under the foot and across the top, finishing by trapping it with the same foot (forms an “S”).\n* Pinch with the non-dominant foot if needed. Stand, slide hands, re-wrap each cycle.\n\n## Programming (Strength Focus)\n\n* Beginners: 3–5 ascents of 8–12 ft (2.5–3.5 m) with full rest; stop a rep or two before grip fails.\n* Intermediate: 4–6 ascents of 12–15 ft; tempo 1–2 sec slides, no jumping down.\n* Accessory: 2–3 sets each of hanging knee raises, scapular pull-ups, and farmer’s carries for grip.\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n* **Arms-only pulling** (don’t stand up with legs).\n* **Loose feet** (forgetting to pinch/lock before sliding hands).\n* **Bent wrists / shrugging** (keep wrists neutral, shoulders packed).\n* **Looking straight up** (neck strain; keep a neutral gaze).\n\n## Safety Notes\n\n* Don’t climb if the anchor is questionable or the rope is frayed.\n* No jumping from height. Control every descent.\n* If new to climbing or you have shoulder/elbow issues, get a coach’s eye first.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also provide a beginner progression (no rope yet) or a printable checklist.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Place your hands against a pool wall to hold yourself steady. Push your feet off the ground and extend your legs behind you so you’re nearly floating (your feet will want to keep sinking down). Hold your arms out straight so you’re as horizontal as possible in the water. Have children or people who don't want to be underwater hold their head above water (or put their arms on top of the wall so their head and arms are dry). As you get more comfortable with this position, practice lowering your face into the water. Your body will float easier and stay aligned when your head is down. Try a snorkeling mask in the beginning so you can keep your head down. Later, ditch the mask and lift your head above water when you need to breathe. 2. Use your hip muscles to push one leg down in the water. Begin your kick cycle with your dominant leg. Keep your entire leg fairly straight and relaxed through the knee and ankle joints without bending your knee very much (this helps you stay streamlined). Keep your toes pointed and turned slightly inward. Feel the power of the kick move from your hip, through your knee, and finish in your foot. Your foot moving down through the water creates propulsion. 3. Repeat with the other leg while you lift your first leg back up. In the beginning, let your first leg float back up on its own—as you master the kick, keep your hip muscles engaged to raise your leg and balance your kick strokes. Remember to power your kick from the hips and push the water backward with pointed toes. Keep your kicks fairly small. It’s OK if your heels break the surface of the water, but keep the majority of your kick in line with your body. To develop your upbeat (raising your leg during a kick cycle), position yourself vertically in the water and kick back and forth rather than up and down. 4. Continue alternating legs to flutter kick. Maintain alternating beats—as one leg goes down, the other comes up. Increase the speed as the motions become more comfortable. When you flutter kick quickly, the force will drive your legs and hips upwards so they’re horizontally aligned with your body. If your legs keep sinking, push your chest slightly further down in the water to balance your body alignment. If your legs are rising too much, keep your chest slightly higher in the water or try kicking with lower speed and power. Hold the wall until you can maintain a balanced, horizontal body position while kicking and barely touching the wall. Then it’s time to get moving! 5. Hold on to a kick board to support yourself while kicking. Instead of a wall, grab a kick board by the short edge and hold it at arm’s length in front of you. Push off of the pool floor to elongate your body horizontally, then start flutter kicking like before. If you’re using proper form, you’ll start moving forward. Try to keep your head down (and come up to breathe) or use a snorkeling mask to keep your full body aligned. Notice how the kick propels you forward and holds your legs up. Avoid using a kickboard for someone younger than 6 years old since it may not teach proper swimming technique. [7] X Expert Source Brad Hurvitz Certified Survival Swimming Instructor Expert Interview 6. Push off from a pool wall to practice gliding and body alignment. At the surface or under the water, place your feet against a wall and straighten your legs to push off. Extend your arms in front of you (one hand over the other, like a torpedo), elongate your body into a horizontal line, and point your toes. Glide through the water and begin flutter kicking as soon as you feel yourself losing momentum. Kick fast enough to keep your body horizontal. Most of your speed will come from adding arms (kicking powers about 15% of your speed). For practice, try gliding a few times without adding the kick to get used to the feeling of your body cutting through the water. 7. Practice timing your kicks with arm strokes. Push downward with the leg opposite from the arm that’s starting your stroke cycle (for example, extend your right arm forward, over your head, and bring it down through the water while your left leg begins kicking), and repeat on the opposite side. There’s no rule on how many kicks per stroke you need, but the most common ratios are the 2-, 4-, and 6-beat kicks: 2-beat kick: Kick each leg once per stroke cycle (a cycle means both arms have completed a stroke). 4-beat kick: Kick each leg twice per cycle (in other words, each leg kicks once for each arm stroke). 6-beat kick: Kick each leg 3 times per cycle. Kick right-left-right while your left arm strokes, then left-right-left while your right arm strokes. 8. Freestyle stroke To swim freestyle (front crawl), flutter kick and make sweeping windmill motions with your arms. Reach each arm forward and bring it into the water fingertips-first, just wider than your shoulders. Bend at the elbow and scoop the water behind you to propel forward. Picture your forearm and hand like a giant paddle. This is called an early vertical forearm (EVF). Keep your elbows high as your hand exits the water. As a rule of thumb, keep your elbows higher than your hands both above and below the water. Notice how the flutter kick stabilizes your body position and supports the movement of your arms. 9. Backstroke To do a backstroke , float on your back and elongate your body into a straight line. Flutter kick like normal, except now you’re pushing up on the water instead of down. Use your shoulders to lift each arm out of the water thumb-first and rotate them backward, similar to a freestyle stroke. Keep your arm straight and enter the water pinky-first with your palm facing outward. Rotate your palm down and use it to scoop or push the water back. As your arm comes up, rotate your palm inward before it breaks the surface of the water for the next stroke. Keep your form the same as usual—drive the kick from your hips, keep your knees mostly straight, and point your toes behind you. 10. Dog paddle Use the dog paddle to stay afloat or swim short distances. Keep your head above water and float from your chest. Alternately move each hand forward and downward, then backward and upward in circular motions under the water. Flutter kick as normal. The dog paddle isn’t an official swim stroke, but is fairly intuitive and easy to accomplish (and it’s named after how your favorite 4-legged companions swim). Move your limbs slowly and let your mouth go under water to save energy. Push and kick faster to raise your head and breathe. 11. Kicking too big Keep your legs and kicks in line with your body as much as possible, aiming to keep the amplitude of your kick at about 0.5 m (1.6 ft) (this means your feet shouldn’t move more than this distance above or below your hips). When you start making huge, wide kicks, you end up creating drag which slows you down (and takes a lot more energy). Remember, big kicks don't equal fast swimming. To increase your speed, keep your kicks fast and small. 12. Bending too much at the knees Let your knees relax so they bend slightly with the pressure of the water rather than bending them on purpose to propel yourself. These “bicycle” kicks feel natural, but they ruin your streamlined body position and throw you off balance. Remember to drive your kicks from the hips and to keep your legs fairly straight. This helps with propulsion and counterbalancing your arm strokes. Kicking at the knees will make your legs sink, causing you to slow down and lose your forward-moving momentum. 13. Kicking down instead of backward Imagine pushing water backward and away from you with your feet rather than sending it downward. To do this, keep your ankles loose and flexible and your toes pointed—if your ankles are stiff or locked, you’ll have to bend your knee nearly 90 degrees to get any push. Keeping your ankles loose and your toes pointed helps balance your upbeat (the lifting of your leg during a kick) with the downbeat (pushing your leg down).",

    "GPT_text": "Here are the **text steps** to practice and perfect your flutter kick for speed and balance. (The visual steps are provided separately in the image above.)\n\n# Flutter Kick: Speed + Balance — Text Guide\n\n1. Set Your Body Line\n\n* Float face-down, eyes to the pool floor, neck long.\n* Squeeze glutes lightly, tuck ribs, draw belly button toward spine.\n* Arms in a tight streamline or at your sides for drills. The goal: a straight, buoyant line.\n\n2. Drive From the Hips (not the knees)\n\n* Initiate each kick from the glutes/hips.\n* Knees bend a little (~10–20°) as a consequence, not a cause.\n* Ankles loose, toes pointed; think “whip” not “stomp.”\n\n3. Find Side Balance — 6-1-6 Drill\n\n* Kick on your right side for 6 kicks (bottom arm extended, top arm on thigh, ear on shoulder).\n* Take 1 stroke to rotate, then 6 kicks on your left side.\n* Keep hips and shoulders rolling together; head stays neutral.\n\n4. Stabilize With a Board (or Snorkel)\n\n* Arms straight on a kickboard, elbows soft; chin down.\n* Keep kicks narrow; let heels just kiss the surface for light splashes/bubbles.\n* Focus on a steady rhythm you could hold for minutes.\n\n5. Own Your Back — Streamline on Back\n\n* Arms overhead in streamline, eyes up.\n* Press ribs down so hips don’t sink.\n* Kick small and fast, keeping knees below the surface.\n\n6. Build Power Safely — Vertical Kick (Deep Water)\n\n* Stay tall, hands by your sides or across chest.\n* Small, fast hip-driven kicks to hover; avoid cycling legs like riding a bike.\n* Progression: 20–30s sets; make it harder by raising hands above head.\n\n7. Add Speed With Tempo Control\n\n* Keep amplitude small (about 6–12 in / 15–30 cm).\n* Gradually increase cadence while staying relaxed—quick flicks, not big slaps.\n* Use short sprints (e.g., 4×15 m fast kick) to rehearse race tempo.\n\n8. Breathe Without Breaking the Line (for freestyle)\n\n* Maintain the kick during the breath.\n* Roll body as one unit; inhale with one goggle in the water.\n* Exhale steadily; return face down without a kick pause.\n\n---\n\n## Weekly Mini-Plan (2–3×/week, ~20–30 min)\n\n* Warm-up: 4×25 easy flutter (2 on back, 2 on stomach).\n* Drill set:\n\n  * 4×25 6-1-6 (odd right/left, even left/right) :15 rest\n  * 4×25 kickboard steady, heels just breaking surface :15\n  * 4×20s vertical kick, :20 rest (last rep hands up if solid)\n* Speed set: 6×25 streamline kick on back, descend 1–3 and 4–6 (get faster) :20\n* Finish: 2×25 freestyle swim focusing on continuous kick into and out of the breath.\n\n## Cues You Can Repeat to Yourself\n\n* “Long spine, soft neck.”\n* “Hips lead, toes flick.”\n* “Small and quick.”\n* “Kick never stops—especially when I breathe.”\n\n## Common Errors → Quick Fixes\n\n* Big, splashy kicks → Shrink the kick; move faster, not bigger.\n* Knees popping out of water → Start motion from hips; keep thighs just under surface.\n* Sinking hips → Engage core, press chest/ribs down, look straight down.\n* Gasping during breath → Keep one goggle in, keep kicking, exhale in the water.\n\n## Helpful (Optional) Gear\n\n* Snorkel: lets you focus on body line and kick rhythm.\n* Short fins: teach relaxed ankles and tempo (use sparingly).\n* Kickboard: stability; mix in no-board sets so posture transfers to swimming.\n\nStay relaxed, keep the kick compact, and build tempo gradually—speed will come from rhythm and balance, not force.\n",

It involves a continuous, alternating up-and-down movement of the legs, originating from the hips. Here's how you can practice and perfect your flutter kick:\n\n**Step 1: Body Position**\nStart by lying flat in the water, face down, with your body streamlined. Your head should be in line with your spine, and your eyes looking down. Your arms can be extended forward or by your sides for balance.\n**Step 2: Initiate from the Hips**\nThe flutter kick should originate from your hips, not your knees. Imagine your legs as extensions of your torso. Keep a slight bend in your knees, but don't let them bend too much, as this creates drag.\n**Step 3: Ankle Flexibility**\nPoint your toes and keep your ankles relaxed and flexible. This allows your feet to act like fins, creating a larger surface area to push against the water and generate propulsion. Stiff ankles will make your kick less effective.\n**Step 4: Continuous and Alternating Motion**\nYour legs should move in a continuous, alternating up-and-down motion. As one leg kicks down, the other leg recovers and moves up. Maintain a consistent rhythm. The kick should be relatively narrow, with your feet staying within the width of your hips.\n**Step 5: Practice with a Kickboard**\nUsing a kickboard is an excellent way to isolate your legs and focus on your kick technique. Hold the kickboard out in front of you with extended arms and focus solely on generating propulsion with your flutter kick.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Lock your ankle. Locking your ankle ensures that your foot isn't flimsy and doesn't move at all when it contacts the ball. The foot needs to control how the ball moves. For an inside of the foot pass, the toes should point up to lock the ankle. For a shot, on the other hand, the toes should point down to lock the ankle. The only way to achieve no spin is to lock your ankle. If the foot is flimsy, the ball will make equally flimsy movements and motions. 2. Pass the ball with the inside of the shoe. Never pass on your toe. Soccer players pass using the inside of the foot because it uses a wider surface area and makes for the most accurate kick. The downside to this kick is that you don't get as much power out of it. Still, it is definitely the most accurate way to pass. 3. Position your planter foot. Turn your planter foot (the foot you are not using to kick) so that the inside of your shoe is facing the ball. Remember, your planter foot will point to where the ball ends up. If you want to kick the ball straight ahead, plant that foot facing straight ahead. 4. Kick a pass on the ground. Follow through with your foot close to the ground. For short passes and passes on the ground, you only need to follow through a few feet. Don't lift your foot far off the ground. Notice the spin on the ball. An inside of the foot pass should have end over end spin. If the ball is spinning outside in, you need to lock your ankle, or you might have moved your passing leg in the right trajectory. 5. Kick a pass in the air. Lean your body back and follow through with your foot in the air. This time, extend your foot fully, and follow through so that your foot ends up several feet in the air. Make sure that if you're passing in the air, you keep your foot closer to the ground than you would for a ground pass so that the ball will go into the air. Again, notice the spin on the ball. Just like a pass on the ground, a pass in the air should have end over end spin. If the ball is spinning outside in, make sure you're locking your ankle and watching your passing leg.",

The last step is a little longer to lower your hips.\n\n3. **Plant foot position**\n   Place your non-kicking (plant) foot **4–6 in / 10–15 cm** beside the ball with toes pointing at the target; knee slightly bent.\n\n4. **Body shape for power & accuracy**\n   Lean your torso slightly forward, chest over the ball. Arms out for balance. Head steady.\n\n5. **Eyes on the contact point**\n   Keep your eyes on the **middle of the ball** for a driven shot.\n   • For a **low** shot, strike through the ball’s midline or just **above** it.\n   • To **lift** the ball, strike just **below** the midline.\n\n6. **Lock the ankle**\n   Point your toe **down** and make the ankle firm so the foot is a solid surface.\n\n7. **Strike with the laces**\n   Hit the ball with the **instep (laces)** of your shoe.

Land on the kicking foot and run through.\n\n## Quick fixes to common mistakes\n\n* Ball flying high? You’re leaning back—get your chest over the ball.\n* No power? Your ankle is floppy—**lock it** and swing through.\n* Slicing wide? Plant foot may be turned; aim its toes at the target.\n* Shanking the ball? You’re too close/far—keep plant foot ~4–6 in (10–15 cm) from the ball’s side.\n\n## Bonus: inside-foot pass (accuracy-first)\n\n* Plant as above, but **open the hip** and point toes **up** on the kicking foot.\n* Contact with the **inside** of the foot; short, straight follow-through at the target.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a second visual just for the inside-foot pass or for curving/chipping the ball.\n",

This foot is crucial for balance and aiming.\n\n\n**Step 2: Backswing and Arm Position**\nAs you plant your non-kicking foot, bring your kicking leg back, bending your knee slightly. The further back you swing, the more power you'll generate. Keep your arms out to your sides for balance.\n**Step 3: Strike the Ball**\nPoint your toes down and lock your ankle. Strike the ball with the \"laces\" part of your foot (the top of your foot where your shoelaces are). Aim for the middle of the ball for a powerful, straight shot.

    "text_ref": "1. Lie down on the floor. Lie down on a fitness mat. Lie with your back flat on the ground, legs together and knees bent. Keep in mind that this movement is not recommended for anyone who has ever had a back problem. This movement can be made easier by placing your hands and arms lower on your body (crossing arms in front of your chest) or harder, by placing your hands and arms past your head (arms extended above your head). 2. Turn your legs to one side. With your knees remaining bent, turn at your waist and bring both of your legs to one side of your body, down to the floor. Your legs should be lying on top of each other. As you bring your legs down to the floor, keep your shoulder blades and the upper part of your back flat on the floor. Your rib cage should be down and not flared out in this position. If you overextend, you risk straining your upper back. [4] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 3. Crunch to your side. Place your hands behind or at the sides of your head. Flex your abdominal muscles, and lift your shoulders off the floor. Be sure to keep your shoulders straight and level just as you would for a normal crunch. Hold the position for a moment, then release your constricted abdominal muscles to slowly bring your shoulders back down to the mat. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Do not pull at your head and neck to complete the crunch. Your hands are merely resting near your head as you contract your abdominal muscles to lift yourself up and crunch. [7] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview Exhale as you crunch and inhale as you return to your starting position. Then, repeat. Breathing properly will put your diaphragm in a better position for abdominal work. [8] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 4. Complete your crunches on the other side of your body. Once you have completed one set of crunches on one side of your body (about 10–15 reps), turn your legs over to do the crunches on other side of your body. It’s recommended to do this exercise 1–3 sets on each side, 2–3 times a week.",

    "text_ref": "1. This sets you up to box out an opposing player and get the rebound. It doesn’t matter if you’re on offense or defense. Wait for the ball to be in the air on its way to the basket, then run and position yourself close to the backboard, anticipating the rebound. Often, watching an opponent pass the ball with peripheral vision can be mistaken for a shot, particularly if it is a lob pass across the court. Listen for your teammates yelling, \"shot\" in case someone takes a shot that you don’t see right away. If you see a shot taken, yell \"shot\" yourself so others can hear you. 2. This allows you to anticipate the direction the rebound comes. Get in front of the player you’re boxing out and face the net, keeping your body between your opponent and the basket. Get ready to think quickly and go for the ball when it bounces off the rim or backboard! If you’re on defense and you are facing the player you’re guarding, make contact with your opponent’s chest using your forearm. Then, quickly turn your body to the opposite side of the arm you extended to back pivot into them and face the net. [1] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview 3. The player you box out can vary depending on what defense is being played. If you’re playing man-to-man defense, box out whoever you are assigned to guard. Box out the closest person to you if you’re playing zone defense. Once you’re near the backboard after a shot, find the player and get ready to box them out. If it’s clear that a teammate will not be able to box out their own man, and their man is closer to the basket than your man, move to box out the opponent closest to the basket instead. If you're playing a high position in the zone, or closer to the top of the key, past the free throw line, try to select an opponent who is also above the key. If you're playing a low position, closer to the basket, try to find someone near you in the paint. 4. This lets you use your base and core to keep the opponent away. Set your feet in a wide stance, preferably wider than your opponent’s. Squat down, stay balanced, and extend your buttocks slightly back towards the player you’re boxing out. It’s okay to make contact with the player you’re guarding, just don’t aggressively shove them or anything like that or you might get a foul. 5. Putting your arms out wide makes it harder to get around you. Keep your arms up, but make sure not to wrap them around your opponent. Trying to hold the player you’re guarding in place is a foul. Make sure to keep both your arms and legs spread wide to create a “box” that’s hard for the player you’re guarding to get around and go for the rebound from. 6. This is the most effective way to get your opponent out of your zone. Use your arms to feel which direction the player is trying to get around you in and move with them. Stay in front of the player and push backwards with your butt to push them away from the basket. If you feel that the opponent is moving in one direction, try to push them the opposite way to counteract their movement. Keep your wide stance and stay low as you move, using your body weight to keep the player you’re guarding from getting to the ball. 7. Once you have your opponent boxed out, it’s time to go for the rebound. Keep your eyes on the ball, anticipating where it’s going to go, and get ready to move in the direction of the rebound. Don’t wait for the ball to come to you, but rather be ready to release your box out position and jump for the ball. Stopping your opponent’s momentum is often enough to keep them from attempting a rebound, and even if they try to keep going, you have an advantage of position. 8. Now it’s time to get that rebound. When the shot bounces off the basket in your direction, move into position where you think it’s coming and jump up to grab it with your arms fully extended. Try to meet the ball at the highest point of your jump and snatch the basketball firmly for a successful rebound. As long as you time it right, it should be very difficult for the player you boxed out to get the rebound, even if they are taller than you. 9. ”Chinning” is the most effective way to secure the ball after a rebound. Do this by putting the ball underneath your chin and sticking your elbows out. Hold the ball tightly and refrain from dribbling for a second or two as many defenders will attempt to hit it out of your hands. Don't swing your elbows, you don't want to commit a foul or hurt anyone, but bring them out as wide as possible to protect the ball. 10. The heat’s on you now, so get rid of the ball to an open teammate. Look to throw an outlet pass to a streaking player or to a guard located near the sidelines. Ideally, Look for your point-guard and pass them the ball if they’re open. If you just got a defensive rebound and you are the point-guard, look up the court for an open teammate close to the basket. Otherwise, look to set up your offense. If you’re a guard and you just got the defensive rebound, you can wait for the defenders to clear and dribble the ball up the court yourself.",

    "GPT_text": "# How to Box Out in Basketball (Text-Only)\n\nBelow is a clear, step-by-step breakdown you can follow on court. Use the **Quick Cues** to self-check form.\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Stance**\n   Athletic base: feet shoulder-width, knees bent, hips low, chest up, back neutral, heels light.\n\n2. **Locate ball & matchup**\n   See **both**: ball and your assignment. As the shot goes up, call **“Shot!”** to alert teammates.\n\n3. **Step to meet (no backpedal)**\n   Close space **toward** your opponent. Beat them to the spot; don’t wait under the rim.\n\n4. **Make legal first contact**\n   Use hips/glutes and forearm frame (arm out, elbow in) to absorb their momentum. Contact is firm, not a push.\n\n5. **Reverse pivot & seal**\n   Reverse-pivot so your **back/hips** face the opponent and your chest faces the basket.\n   Drop-step the foot closest to the rim to put your body **between opponent and hoop**.\n\n6. **Widen & hold**\n   Feet a bit wider than shoulders; sit your hips down. Arms out in a strong “T” to feel the opponent. Keep contact.\n\n7. **Slide and track the ball**\n   Shuffle laterally to stay between your matchup and the rim. Keep eyes on the ball’s arc; keep contact with the body.\n\n8. **Go get it (two hands)**\n   Time the peak/first bounce. Explode **up** off two feet if you can, grab **with two hands**, land balanced, **chin the ball** (ball to chest, elbows strong), then **pivot away** and outlet.\n\n9. **Finish the box**\n   Maintain your seal **until** the ball is secured by you or a teammate—don’t release early.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Cues\n\n* “See **man + ball**.”\n* “**Hit** (legal contact), **seal**, then **get** (rebound).”\n* “Low hips, wide base, hands out.”\n* “Move your **feet**, don’t use your **hands** to push.”\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n* Ball-watching before you find your man.\n* Standing under/inside the charge circle—gives the offense angles.\n* Reaching or wrapping with hands (foul risk).\n* Turning your back to the **ball** instead of the opponent.\n* Releasing the box out before the rebound is secured.\n\n## Variations\n\n* **Free-throw box out:** Step across and seal **as the shooter releases**; hold until the ball hits rim.\n* **Long rebounds (3-pt shots):** Expect longer caroms; after sealing, take **one step out** toward the free-throw line area before jumping.\n* **Smaller vs bigger opponent:** Emphasize **lower leverage** (hips under), earlier contact, and continuous slides.\n",

[1] X Expert Source Yvonne Mo Fitness and Health Coach & Kung Fu Instructor Expert Interview Hold your arms out straight in front of your chest. Bend your knees slightly and shift your weight to the balls of your feet. To make jumping a little easier, try starting with your right foot lifted off the ground and all of your weight on your left foot. Keep your core tight by clenching your abs throughout the whole motion. This helps support your body. You can start on your right foot instead and reverse these directions. It doesn’t matter which side you start on. Make sure to keep your hips straight. [3] X Expert Source Yvonne Mo Fitness and Health Coach & Kung Fu Instructor Expert Interview 2. Push off your left foot to hop to the right. Quickly shift all of your weight onto your left foot and lift your right foot. Then, push off the ground hard with your left foot to hop sideways. Take a small jump if you’re just getting started. As you get better, push harder and jump further. Some variations say to keep your hands in front of your chest during the bound. Others say to pump your arms with each bound, which gives you a more intense workout. 3. Land with all of your weight on your right foot and keep your left foot lifted. Come down on the ball of your right foot to maintain your balance as you land. Bend your knee to absorb the impact and prepare to hop back. Keep your left foot lifted slightly off the ground so all of your weight is on your right foot. Left foot positioning varies. Some say to keep the left foot near the right knee, and others prefer to sweep it back behind their left leg. Do what you're most comfortable with! If you’re having trouble keeping your balance, take a smaller hop. 4. Pause for a moment and push off your right foot to jump left. Hold your position for a second, then spring off your right foot to the side again, jumping back to the left. Don’t worry if you lose your balance. Just reset yourself and keep going. 5. Land on your left foot to complete a rep. Try to land on the ball of your left foot, keeping your right foot off the ground. This completes 1 repetition of a lateral bound. 6. Repeat this movement 10 times for a full set. Continue bounding from side to side to train your legs, hips, and core muscles as well as get your heart rate up. After a few reps, you’ll start feeling the burn! Try doing 2 sets of 10 reps to start. You can add more reps later as you get better at the exercise. Time the exercise instead of counting reps for a great workout. Set a 1-minute timer and bound side to side as many times as you can until the timer goes off. As an alternative, simply bound back and forth until you can't do anymore reps. This is a more intense workout.",

Load hips back slightly; arms swing back.\n\n**Movement**\n3) **Push off hard** the inside foot—triple extend (ankle-knee-hip) and swing arms across to drive you sideways.\n4) **Travel laterally**, not up. Keep hips and chest square; don’t rotate through the torso.\n5) **Land softly** on the opposite foot: mid-foot first, knee bent and stacked over toes, hips back to absorb.\n6) **Stabilize** (“stick”) for 1–2 seconds—no wobble—then repeat to the other side.\n\n**Coaching cues (think while you move)**\n\n* “Chest tall, hips back.”\n* “Knee tracks over toes.”\n* “Quiet feet—soft land.”\n* “Project sideways; minimize vertical bounce.”\n* “Use your arms.”\n\n**Common mistakes**\n\n* Knee collapsing inward on landing.\n* Landing on the toes or a locked knee.\n* Twisting the torso or letting the trail leg sweep way behind (over-crossing).\n* Rushing the rebound before you’ve stuck the landing.\n\n**Progressions & scaling**\n\n* **Easier:** tap the free foot for balance after each landing; reduce distance.\n* **Standard:** single-leg stick each rep (2–3s).\n* **Harder:** continuous bounds (no pause), add mini-hurdles or a floor line to clear, or hold a light med ball at chest.\n\n**Programming (agility focus)**\n\n* Warm-up set: 2×6 bounds (3 each way) with full stick.\n* Power/agility: 3–4 sets of 5–8 bounds per side, rest 60–90 s.\n* Conditioning/footwork: 3–5 rounds of 20–30 s continuous bounds, rest 60 s.\n\n**Safety**\n\n* Use a flat, non-slip surface and supportive shoes.

    "text_ref": "1. Find a good spot. To begin with, find a flat space to practice this trick. If you are not experienced with skateboarding, you will want to do this in a place where the board will remain completely still (e.g. will not roll). If you are concerned about falling, you might even want to start in the grass or even a carpeted surface. 2. Position your feet. Place your front foot near the middle of your board, about two inches from your bolts. Put your back foot on the tail. Your front foot should be completely on the skateboard, just behind the front bolts. The ball of your back foot should align with the center of the board. This means your heel will stick out, off the board's surface. Both feet should face straight ahead. Do not angle either foot on the board. 3. Bend your knees. You'll need to bend your knees so you can both pop the tail and jump up. 4. Pop the tail. Rapidly and forcefully push down hard on the tail of your board with your back foot The downward force you apply to the tail of the skateboard will cause it to strike the ground, resulting in powerful upward momentum on the board as it \"pops\" up. Think of this as a light-footed flick downwards with your ankle. [4] X Expert Source Jon Depoian Skateboarding Instructor Expert Interview Be careful not to push too hard down on your tail, because then your weight will prevent the board from going up in the air. [5] X Expert Source Jon Depoian Skateboarding Instructor Expert Interview 5. Jump up. Immediately after popping the tail, straighten your legs to jump up into the air. 6. Sweep your front foot along the board. Slide the side of your front foot along the surface of the board as the front end comes up. The friction of your foot rubbing against the rough grip tape will help drag the board upward along with your body. 7. Level out. Bring up your back foot and level the board underneath you with your feet as you reach the high point of your jump. You may need to push down slightly on your front foot to get the board level with your shoulders. 8. Land. Extend your legs to the ground as you drop, keeping your knees bent to absorb the shock of landing. Keeping your knees bent is important both for avoiding knee injury and keeping control of the board.",

Crouch\n\n* Bend knees and load your legs like springs.\n* Keep weight centered over the bolts.\n\n3. Pop\n\n* Stomp the tail straight down with the back foot.\n* At the same time, start rising with your body (don’t jump off the board).\n\n4. Drag\n\n* Slide the side of your front foot up the grip toward the nose.\n* This pulls the board upward—keep shoulders level.\n\n5. Level\n\n* As the board rises, bring both knees up.\n* Shift slightly forward so the deck levels out beneath you.\n\n6. Peak\n\n* At the top, board is flat and under your feet; stay relaxed and compact.\n\n7. Land\n\n* Aim to land with feet over the bolts.\n* Absorb impact by bending knees; keep weight centered.\n\n8. Roll Away\n\n* Stay loose, look where you’re going, and ride out smoothly.\n\nQuick drills\n\n* Practice the pop + drag on carpet/grass first.\n* Do slow-roll ollies, then add a tape line to clear.\n* Keep sessions short to avoid sore ankles.\n\nCommon fixes\n\n* Board won’t rise: drag your front foot more.\n* Board kicks out behind: pop straight down, not backward.\n* Landing off-bolts: look forward and keep shoulders square.\n\nIf you want, I can add variations (higher ollies, onto/over obstacles) or a printable checklist.\n",

This \"pop\" should make the tail hit the ground, lifting the front of the board. ### Step 3: Slide Your Front Foot\nImmediately after popping the tail, slide your front foot up the board towards the nose. The side of your shoe should drag along the grip tape, leveling out the board in the air. ### Step 4: Lift Your Back Foot\nAs you slide your front foot, bring your back foot up to allow the tail to rise. This helps to get the board higher in the air and keep it level. \n### Step 5: Land\nOnce the board is level and at its peak height, begin to bring your feet down, absorbing the impact by bending your knees as you land.

    "prompt": "How to do wall ball shots? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Find a strong wall that’s at least 10 ft (3.0 m) high. If you’re at a CrossFit gym, look for the tall wall with a bunch of hash marks or height measurements on it. If you’re not at a CrossFit gym, find a reinforced concrete wall or pillar that won’t dent or break when you hurl a heavy ball at it. If you’re at home, an exterior concrete wall is perfect. It may be kind of tough to do wall balls indoors at home. 2. Grab a soft wall ball or medicine ball that weighs around 9 lb (4.1 kg). Wall balls are soft, heavy balls that kind of resemble plushy medicine balls. Pick up a wall ball that weighs 9 pounds (4.1 kg) if you’re just starting out. You can use a slightly heavier or lighter ball depending on your level of fitness. The form and number of repetitions are much more important than the weight of the ball, so opt for a lighter ball if you aren’t sure how heavy you should go. You’ll still get a great workout in with a 6 lb (2.7 kg) ball! If all you’ve got is a soft medicine ball, no problem. There isn’t that much of a difference. 3. Hold the ball out from your chest and touch it against the wall. Stand in front of your wall and hold the ball out with both hands. Touch the ball barely against the wall. This is where you’ll stand for the entire exercise. If you stand too close to the wall, you’ll have to throw the ball straight up and won’t have enough room to catch it. If you stand too far away, you’re making the exercise a lot harder and you’ll need to move forward to catch the ball if you don’t throw it hard enough. 4. Squat with the ball under your chin and keep your shoulders back. Hold the ball by its sides with both of your hands. Spread your feet out so that they’re resting under your shoulders and go into a squat position with the ball tucked under your chin. Lower your hips so that they go just below your knees and keep your shoulders pinched back so that you’re looking up at the wall. Keep your back tilted towards the wall, not the floor. At no point in the squat should you be looking down at the ground. For every squat you do, your hips must drop below the height of your knees for it to count as a full repetition. 5. Aim the ball 8–10 ft (2.4–3.0 m) above you and throw it at the wall. Explode up from your squat and push the wall ball up in the air. Aim to hit the 8–10 ft (2.4–3.0 m) hash mark on the wall. If you aren’t in a CrossFit gym, just choose a spot above you on the wall and aim for the same spot every time. Release the ball and keep your feet underneath you. It’s okay if you jump a little bit as you’re releasing the ball. It’s also okay if you don’t jump. The goal is to hit the same spot every single time you throw the ball up, so jump if you think you need a little extra power! You should be standing nearly all the way up as you release the ball. Just bend your knees a little to maintain your balance once the ball is on its way back down. 6. Catch the ball with both hands to complete 1 rep. Let the ball bounce off the wall and track it visually as it comes back down. Brace the ball with both hands and pull it back to your chest. Keep your knees bent and your feet under you so you can transition into the second rep right away. If you drop the ball or miss your catch entirely, don’t worry. This takes a little coordination. Just pick the ball up off of the ground, stick it out against the wall from your chest, and start a new rep. 7. Drop back into a squat immediately and repeat the exercise. As you finish catching the ball, lower yourself back into the next squat right away. You count 1 rep once you catch the ball, but the goal here is to keep your movement as fluid as possible. Continue throwing the ball up and catching it to push through your workout. You can do 3 sets of 10-15 reps to add the wall ball exercise to your regular workout routine, or you could do as many reps as you can in 1-2 minutes. If you’re in a CrossFit class, your instructor will assign you a number of repetitions or time limit.",

Follow through toward the mark.\n\n6. **Catch & absorb**\n\n   * Hands up early; receive the ball at face/chest height.\n   * Pull it back to your chest and **ride it down** immediately into the next squat.\n   * Maintain your stance distance so the ball drops straight back to you.\n\n7. **Rhythm & breathing**\n\n   * Cadence: **down → up → throw → catch (into down)**.\n   * Inhale on the way down, exhale during the drive/throw.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Cues\n\n* “Heels down.”\n* “Chest tall, elbows under.”\n* “Use legs, not arms.”\n* “Catch high, squat to absorb.”\n\n## Common Mistakes (and fixes)\n\n* **Too close to the wall:** ball ricochets—step back to arm’s length.\n* **Early arm throw:** wait until legs extend, then finish with arms.\n* **Collapsing chest / ball drifting off chest:** keep elbows under, ribs down.\n* **Shallow squat or heels lifting:** widen stance slightly, slow the descent.\n\n## Scaling & Progressions\n\n* Lighter ball or lower target.\n* **Wall toss only:** small squat + toss to a low mark to learn timing.\n* **Tempo reps:** 3-sec down, explosive up to groove mechanics.\n\n## Safety Tips\n\n* Use a solid wall/target; clear the area.\n* If shoulders or knees are irritated, reduce depth/target height or sub light thrusters.\n* Stop if you lose control of the ball—reset your distance and brace.\n\n## Practice Starter\n\n* 3 sets × 10 smooth reps, resting 60–90s.\n* Focus on consistent height and clean catches.\n\n---\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor the target height/ball weight to your current ability and space.\n",

Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, and your toes slightly pointed out. **Step 2: Squat Down**\nInitiate a squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees, as if sitting in a chair. Keep your chest up, and ensure your knees track over your toes. Descend until your thighs are parallel to the floor or slightly below. Keep the medicine ball at chest height. **Step 3: Explode Up and Throw**\nFrom the bottom of the squat, powerfully drive through your heels and extend your hips and knees to stand up. As you stand, simultaneously push the medicine ball upward and slightly forward, aiming for a target on the wall (often 9-10 feet high). Extend your arms fully. **Step 4: Catch and Repeat**\nAs the medicine ball comes down, catch it with both hands at chest height, absorbing the impact by immediately transitioning back into the squat position (Step 2). This allows for a continuous, fluid movement. ",

This will give you enough room to comfortably jump over it, but not so much that you trip over the rope. The rope should have handles that are easy to grip and shouldn't be too light or too heavy. 2. Stand up and pick up the rope. Hold the rope's handles in each of your hands. Extend your hands and forearms at least a foot away from your body, at a 45 degree angle. This will create a larger arc for you to jump through. 3. Step over the rope. The rope should hang behind you, so that the middle of the rope hits the back of your feet. 4. Use your hands and wrists to swing the rope over your head. Don't move your arms -- try to keep the motion limited to your wrists. 5. When the rope is coming toward the front of your feet, hop over it. Stand on your tiptoes, and push off with the balls of your feet. Try to keep the motion in your ankles. Bending your knees to jump will make the exercise a lot harder. 6. Set a pace that works for you. [3] X Expert Source Steve Bergeron Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview For beginners, it's best to move the rope slowly, so that you have enough time to take a small hop in between each jump over the rope. Maintain a straight back and keep your gaze set straight ahead as you fall into the correct rhythm. If you watch your feet as you jump, you'll be more likely to get off balance. As your skill increases, you can swing the rope more quickly and eliminate the middle hop. As you improve your skills, you can count how long you can go without messing up. A fun way to track your progress is to count how many skips you can do in one stretch, without fumbling. Listen to your body. If you're feeling discomfort in your joints, it's better to decrease the exercise intensity. On the other hand, if you're feeling great and want to extend the exercise session, you can do that as well.",

Time the first jump\n\n* As the rope comes down toward your toes, **leave the ground just before it reaches your feet**.\n* Jump straight up only 1–2 inches (2–5 cm).\n\n4. Land softly\n\n* Land on the balls of your feet with knees gently bent.\n* Keep heels light and torso upright (no kicking back or tucking knees).\n\n5. Find the rhythm\n\n* Aim for **1 turn = 1 jump**. Keep the rope speed steady and jumps small.\n* Breathe calmly (e.g., in for 2–3 turns, out for 2–3).\n\n6. Keep going / reset\n\n* If the rope catches, stop, reset to Step 1, and start again.\n* Work in short sets (10–30 seconds), rest, then repeat.\n\nQuick cues\n\n* “Tall spine, elbows in, quiet wrists, quiet feet.”\n* If arms drift wide → pull elbows to ribs.\n* Jumping too high → think “paintbrush bristles off the floor.”\n* Hitting toes late → jump a hair earlier.\n\nWant variations next (boxer step, alternate foot, high-knees) or a beginner practice plan?\n",

When standing on the center of the rope, the handles should come up just below your armpits. It doesn’t matter if you use a lighter or heavier weight. But consistency is key - sticking to the same weight during your practice will help your body memorize the movements more easily. Thinner, lighter ropes will move faster. However, some people like the control they get from the heaviness of a thicker cable. It all depends on your personal preference. More advanced jumpers might try speed ropes to help further develop their technique. 2. Stand with feet hip distance apart with your body tall and relaxed and elbows close to your sides. Swinging your arms away from your body not only tires you out faster, but it actually shortens the arc of the rope, making it more difficult to rotate it quickly enough. Focus your eyes on a point straight in front of you, not looking down or up. Your hands should be slightly in front of your hips and below your elbows for quicker rotations of the rope. 3. Jump with straight legs, keeping them directly beneath you. Straight legs - as opposed to bending your knees - will also allow you to bound up quickly and more efficiently. Push off the ground with your calf muscles and land softly on the balls of your feet. It shouldn’t sound like you’re stomping when you land. Avoid the common “dolphin kick” mistake. Also known as piking, this is when you kick your feet out in front of you when you jump up, throwing off your timing along with your next jump. You don’t have to jump super high - 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) inches off the ground is enough. 4. Practice a minimum of 3 to 5 times per week. It can be frustrating when a new skill is difficult to learn. But practice does make perfect, especially in the case of double unders. Set aside time at least 3 days a week to work solely on your jumping or practice for 5 to 10 minutes before your daily workout. Once you can consistently do 100 single unders in a row without failure, you’re ready to move on to the double under. 5. Learn the power jump to get more height and air time. The higher you jump, the more time there is for the rope to pass underneath of you. Use your legs to propel you up for a jump that’s about twice as high and twice as long as your single under jumps. Fight the temptation to flail or kick up your legs - instead, maintain the same posture you used for the single under. To build up power and stamina, set the rope aside and do box jumps or tuck jumps. They use similar motions and strength and are an effective way to train your body. 6. Focus on only moving your wrists. Contrary to what most people think, the key to turning the rope twice in one jump isn’t how fast you move your arms: it’s how fast you rotate your wrists. A quick flick of the wrist is all it takes. Practice your wrist rotation with isolated drills. Hold 2 pieces of pipe in your hand and imagine you’re painting the inside of a bucket with them, moving only your wrists in small tight circles. Talk about a fast flick: The world record for double unders is held by Shane Winsor who completed 164 in one minute. 7. Jump as soon as you flick your wrists downward. The number one thing that messes people up on double unders is the timing: They either jump too early or too late. As you start to rotate your wrists toward the ground, you should already be preparing to jump back up. To help you stick to a rhythm, listen to a metronome app on your phone or pick a song with a steady quick beat while you jump. 8. Increase the number of double unders. Once you’ve mastered one, begin slowly integrating more double unders into your jumping. Start with two in a row, then three, etc. 9. Time yourself while doing a set number of double unders. See how long it takes you to do 50, 100, or even 1,000 double unders. Then, try to beat that time during your next workout. Just make sure you don’t sacrifice form for speed. This method of \"for time\" workouts is good for increasing endurance. 10. Swap traditional cardio for interval training 2 to 3 days per week. Set a timer and alternate one minute of double unders with one minute of single unders for a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workout. Benefits of HIIT include a healthier heart and increased fat burn up to 24 hours following your workout. You can also mix in other plyometric moves like high knees, air squats or jumping lunges. 11. Try a CrossFit \"Workout of the Day\" to build strength and conditioning. Commonly known as WODs, these intense routines are posted daily and often include double unders mixed in with exercises like sit-ups, rowing, and squats. Do a WOD daily for three days in a row, then take a rest day. Build your own WOD by combining double unders (cardio) with clean and jerks or dumbbell snatches (weight training) for a full-body workout.",

Fit the rope\n   • Stand on the middle of the rope with one foot.\n   • Adjust so the **handles reach about your armpits** (or cable tops near mid-chest for speed ropes).\n\n2. Grip & hand position\n   • Light pinch between thumb and index; relaxed fingers.\n   • Hands slightly in front of hips, a forearm’s width from the body. Elbows tucked.\n\n3. Posture\n   • Stand tall, ribs down, eyes forward.\n   • Shoulders relaxed; core lightly braced.\n\n4. Start with single-unders\n   • Small, quick bounce (1–2 in / 3–5 cm).\n   • Land softly on the mid-foot; heels kiss the floor.\n\n5. Power jump\n   • Every few singles, do one **slightly higher** jump to buy airtime.\n   • Body stays straight—no tucking knees or piking.\n\n6. Double wrist flick\n   • On the power jump, **snap the wrists twice** quickly.\n   • Arms stay quiet; circles come from the wrists, not the shoulders.\n\n7. Timing cue\n   • Think **“jump—tap-tap”** (two rope turns while you’re airborne).\n   • Exhale on the jump to stay relaxed.\n\n8. Link reps\n   • Progression: **single-single-double → single-double → double-double**.\n   • If you trip, reset with 5–10 singles, then try again.\n\n9. Rope path & hands\n   • Keep hands at hip line, slightly forward; don’t let them drift wide or behind you.\n   • Keep the rope narrow and skimming close to the toes.\n\n10. Land & recover\n    • Land softly, knees unlocked.\n    • Keep sets short at first (5–10 doubles), rest, repeat.\n\nQuick drills (optional):\n• **Penguin taps:** Jump in place and tap thighs twice mid-air to learn timing.\n• **Ghost rope:** No rope—practice the double wrist flick and rhythm.\n• **Single→double ladders:** 3 singles + 1 double, 2 singles + 1 double, 1 + 1, then consecutive doubles.\n\nCommon fixes:\n• **Tripping in front:** Hands too far back—bring them slightly forward.\n• **Gassed out:** You’re jumping too high—aim for just enough airtime.\n• **Shoulder burn:** Circles are too big—glue elbows to ribs and use wrists.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate alternate visuals (e.g., minimalist line art or a printable poster) to match your style or space.\n",

Here's how you can learn to do them:\n\n**Step 1: Master the Basic Jump**\nBefore attempting double unders, ensure you have a consistent and efficient basic jump. Focus on a light bounce, keeping your elbows close to your body, and using your wrists to turn the rope.\n\n**Step 2: Practice the \"Penguin\" Drill**\nWithout the rope, jump normally and tap your thighs twice rapidly with your hands before landing. This simulates the quick wrist rotation needed for double unders and helps build the timing.\n\n**Step 3: Combine Jump and Wrist Speed**\nStart with a few basic jumps, then try to integrate the quick wrist movement and a slightly higher jump, aiming to pass the rope under your feet twice for one jump. It's okay if you only get one or two at first.\n\n**Step 4: Focus on Consistency**\nAs you get more comfortable, try to string together multiple double unders. Maintain a relaxed posture, keep your core engaged, and focus on a steady rhythm. Don't get discouraged by mistakes; consistency comes with practice.\n\n",

    "prompt": "How to Balance a Soccer Ball on Your Foot? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Look for a level surface to stand on. Find a flat surface to prevent the ball from rolling off your foot. Try practicing in your yard, your driveway, or the nearest soccer field. Take advantage of these areas to maintain more control over your balance. The type of surface you play on doesn’t make much of a difference, so go wherever you feel most comfortable. Controlling a ball is easier on a level surface. Once you master the technique, you can balance a ball almost anywhere. 2. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder width apart. Settle into a strong, stable pose. Test out your stance by lifting your foot slightly off the ground. If you feel like you can hold that position for a while, then you are ready to balance a ball. Otherwise, adjust your positioning until you feel balanced. Most people have a tendency to lean forward or backward when balancing a ball, but doing this throws off your balance. 3. Bend your toes toward your ankle to prepare to hold the ball. Lift your foot up off the ground, then raise your toes as if you’re bringing them back towards your shin. The top part of your foot serves as a flat surface to balance the ball. Keep your foot angled slightly with your toes raised so the ball rolls back towards your leg. If your foot points towards the ground, the ball will end up there. At most, hold your foot up at a 45-degree angle. You don’t need to have such a stiff angle, so keep your foot a little flatter to reduce fatigue. 4. Stiffen your ball-holding ankle when placing the ball on your foot. Lift your foot up off the ground slightly, bending your knee before stiffening your ankle. When you balance a soccer ball there, you can't can't move your foot at all. Your leg controls any movements you need to do to keep the ball in place. When you’re ready, put the ball on your foot, resting it against your leg. Test your positioning before placing the ball. Attempt to move your leg from side to side without shifting your foot’s position. Keep your leg strong but your foot relaxed. Lock your ankle, not your knee! If your foot is tense, the ball may bounce off of it. Also, you may end up tiring out more quickly. 5. Move your foot with the ball to maintain balance. Eventually, the ball will roll towards the side of your foot. If you feel the ball rolling toward your right, move your foot to the right. If it goes to your left, move your foot to the left to bring the ball back to the center. Continue making adjustments to keep the ball on your foot for longer periods of time. The key to adjusting is slow, smooth motions. When you feel the ball moving, you may be tempted to swing your foot out quickly towards it. You end up overcompensating and losing control of the ball. Practice often to get a sense of how the ball moves and what you need to do to maintain your balance. Eliminate distractions, then focus on feeling the ball against your foot. 6. Kneel and put the ball on your foot if you’re having trouble balancing. If you’re a beginner, get on your knees with a foot out in front of you. Tip your foot up like you normally would, then reach forward and place the ball. Balance it there for as long as possible. Once you get the hang of it, try it while standing up. Choose a soft or grassy area to avoid scraping your knees while you practice. This pose gets a little uncomfortable on hard surfaces. 7. Roll the ball outside your foot to develop good ball control. Rolling the ball not only looks cool, but it reduces the amount of ball chasing you have to do. To roll it, move your foot on top the ball. Pull the ball towards you, then quickly move your foot behind the ball. Once it rolls on top of your foot, tilt your toes up to balance it in place. Balancing the ball this way is a little more advanced than simply putting it on your feet, but it can help you improve. It also saves you from having to retrieve the ball with your hands each time you drop it. 8. Flick the ball into the air with your foot to juggle and catch it. Hold your leg still like you normally do when balancing the ball, then move your toes and leg to pop the ball back up towards your hands. You can then catch the ball with your hands or attempt to catch it again on your foot for more balancing. To master this technique, you will need to maintain your balance while lifting up the ball and catching it again. This trick is useful for juggling, but it also helps for practicing your balance. The ball may not fall straight down in front of you, so you may need to follow it with your foot. Another way to do this is to set the ball on your foot, balance it as long as possible, then flick it back up into your hands. Doing it that way is useful if you’re having trouble balancing when tossing the ball in the air. 9. Toss the ball into the air with your hands to catch it with your foot. Stand up straight, then pop the ball up in front of you. Keep it close to your body so you don’t have to move far to catch it. Get your foot in position as you normally would so the ball lands on your shoelaces. After it rolls back toward your leg, balance it there. This practice helps you get a sense of how the ball moves over your foot. For the best results, contact the ball with the flat part of your foot right behind your toes. In soccer juggling, this move is known as a foot stall. Even if you don’t plan on doing other tricks, practicing this move will improve your balancing skills.",

Stance\n\n* Stand tall, feet shoulder-width.\n* Choose your dominant foot to balance with; keep the other planted.\n* Lift your balancing leg so your thigh is about parallel to the ground.\n\n2. Make a “table” with your foot\n\n* Dorsiflex the ankle (toes pulled up toward your shin).\n* Keep the foot flat so the top of your foot is level—this is the platform for the ball.\n\n3. Set up the ball\n\n* Start with the ball at rest beside your planted foot.\n* Optional for beginners: place the ball by hand on top of your raised foot to feel the position.\n\n4. Pop the ball up (no-hands method)\n\n* Roll the ball onto the inside of your raised foot.\n* Slide your foot slightly under the ball and lift to pop it gently upward.\n\n5. Catch the ball on your laces\n\n* As the ball rises, keep your ankle locked and toes up.\n* Let the ball settle softly in the center of your foot (over the laces).\n\n6. Micro-adjust to keep it centered\n\n* Make tiny ankle tilts to counter any drift.\n* Keep the knee soft and use your arms out to balance.\n* Eyes on the ball’s center.\n\n7. Hold the stall\n\n* Aim for a 2–5 second hold at first.\n* Breathe and stay relaxed; tension makes the ball bounce off.\n\n8. Dismount & reset\n\n* Gently lower your foot to drop the ball to the ground under control.\n* Reset posture and repeat.\n\n## Quick Tips\n\n* Practice near a wall or in a corner so you’re not chasing the ball.\n* Try wearing cleats or shoes with some grip on the upper while learning.\n* If the ball rolls off your toes: pull the toes higher.\n* If it slides toward your ankle: flatten the foot more and raise the knee slightly.\n* Build up from “hand-place and hold” → “small pop and catch” → “clean stall from the ground.”\n\nIf you want, I can generate an alternate visual focusing on close-ups of the foot angles only.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Shoot a Basketball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Keep your feet no further than shoulder width apart, preferably closer together, and slightly staggered. You should put your shooting foot very slightly ahead of your non-shooting foot. Your shooting foot is the foot on the same side as your shooting arm – if you’re right handed, it will be your right foot. Your feet should be turned 10 to 45 degrees towards your off hand side, and your shoulder, hip, and elbow should be aligned with the basket. 2. Flex your knees slightly. Locking your knees makes it easy for you to get knocked off balance. Flex your knees comfortably so you're in position to jump as soon as you have the ball. Keep your stance in mind as you learn the art of shooting and begin to practice. Once you find the stance that suits you best, use it every single time. The goal is to get so used to the stance that you don't have to think about it before your feet take the right position to let a great shot fly. 3. Turn more in the air and jump forward, keeping your shoulders back, if you need to shoot a longer shot. Your power mostly comes from turning and relaxing your shoulders. Your shot will be much less accurate and fluid if you try to fling the ball forward using power in your chest and arms. Practice jumping from 0 to 90 degrees without the ball to practice your turn. Make sure you are jumping forward and that your shoulders are back and relaxed. 4. Dip the ball down to your waist or thigh. The ball and your shooting eye should form a straight line to the basket. 5. Position your elbow so it's inline with your shoulder, not directly under the ball. Learn to position the ball in this same place every single time you get ready to take a shot. When someone passes you the ball, dip it to your waist or thigh. If you catch a bounce pass or another low pass, or are shooting off the dribble, you don't need to dip, as you are already in a dipping motion. Also, if you are right-handed, keep your left hand on the side on the line and your right hand holding the back of the ball firmly in place. Use your hand that you write with to shoot with. Your other hand is just for the guide. If you are left-handed, do the opposite. 6. Grip the ball correctly. Position your shooting hand so that your fingertips are perpendicular to the seams in the ball. [4] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview This hand is responsible for launching the ball. Place your non-shooting hand on the side of the ball to act as a guide for the shot. Your palm may or may not be touching the ball while you’re preparing to shoot - you may have control of the ball with your fingers and thumb. Leave a little space between your palm and the ball, so the ball will be able to roll off your fingertips with ease. The ball should sit on your finger pads. Spread your fingers wide so you have greater control over the ball. 7. Locate the target. If you want the ball to go into the net, then you need to look at the net. If you’re planning to bank the ball in off the backboard, then look at the spot on the backboard you want to hit. Your eyes are an incredibly important part of a good shot in basketball. Once you release, you may either follow the flight of the ball (which is common among great NBA shooters) or continue to look at the rim. 8. Straighten your knees and jump . Use your legs to help propel the ball by jumping upward while your shooting hand launches the ball and your shoulders lean back. Move your legs, torso, and arms together in a coordinated fashion to take the shot. 9. Jump slightly forward when you shoot, making sure your shoulders lean back and are relaxed. Your feet shouldn't land in the same position where they started because it will cause a lot of tension in your neck and shoulders. Jumping forward will also give your ball more arc. Don't lean forward as you jump. If your body is balanced, you should jump in a natural motion, it will cause your shot to be balanced and relieve tension. 10. Push the ball upward with your shooting hand. As your hips rise up and you start your jumping motion, move the ball in a smooth motion from your dip to eye level. It should all be one smooth motion. Your hips rise as your elbow rises with the ball, and you should turn anywhere from 20-90 degrees towards your off hand. Don't let the ball go behind your head or off to the side. Shoot it in a fluid, forward motion. Your non-shooting hand serves only to guide the ball and to keep it steady while your shooting hand exerts force. 11. Release the ball. Just before you reach the height of your jump, release the ball, with your shooting hand aimed at the basket. Straighten your elbow and push your wrist so that the ball arches, rather than moving toward the basket in a straight line. As you release the ball, your guiding hand should move to lightly touch your shooting arm just below the wrist. Roll the ball off your fingertips toward the basket. You can tell whether you shot it properly by looking at the backspin; if the lines of the basketball spin symmetrically, you positioned the ball properly. [10] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview 12. Follow through. This is a hugely important part of shooting a basketball. If you shoot from your wrist without following through the shot won’t be nearly as accurate. When the shot is complete, your shooting hand will resemble the shape of a swan; your arm is arched elegantly toward the basket, with your hand loosely cocked downward and your fingers pointed toward the hoop. This is called follow through.",

Keep weight centered over the balls of your feet.\n\n2. Grip & hand placement\n   Shooting hand under the ball with fingers spread; index/middle fingers roughly centered. Guide hand on the side—don’t add force with it. Leave a small air gap between palm and ball.\n\n3. Set point (shot pocket)\n   Bring the ball to your chest-to-chin “pocket,” elbows in, eyes on the target. Keep the ball and your body relaxed but ready.\n\n4. Load with the legs\n   Dip slightly and bend knees/hips together. Stay upright (don’t lean), keeping your heels light.\n\n5. Lift & align\n   Rise smoothly: legs start the power, then your shooting arm tracks up so elbow is under the ball and forearm vertical. Keep your eyes on the back of the rim (or a chosen spot).\n\n6. Release\n   At the top of your jump or rise, extend legs then arm in one motion. Snap the wrist so the ball rolls off index/middle fingers to create soft backspin. Guide hand stays still and releases last.\n\n7. Follow-through\n   Finish with elbow extended and wrist relaxed (gooseneck). Hold your follow-through until the ball hits. Land balanced in roughly the same spot you jumped from.\n\n**Quick cues:** “Up, then out,” “Elbow under,” “Guide hand quiet,” “Hold the pose.”\n**Common fixes:** If you’re short—use more legs and arc; if you miss left/right—check feet and elbow alignment; if the ball knuckles—add wrist snap and finger roll.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate separate panel images for each step.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Do a Cardio Workout on Exercise Bikes? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Pace yourself. If you have a new piece of equipment, you may want to leap on and pedal your heart out; however, you'll quickly exhaust yourself if you take this route. Use FITT (Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type of exercise) principles to determine roughly how much exercise you should start with. \"F\" is for Frequency. If you are new to cardiovascular exercise, you should start out by exercising three to five days a week. If you are experienced, you can exercise anywhere from five to seven days a week. \"I\" is for Intensity. This is measured in BPM (beats per minute), so you can measure this best if your bike comes with a heart monitor. Figure out your target heart rate so you know what range is safe for you. \"T\" is for Time. Beginners should try for 20 – 30 minutes a day, while experienced cyclists should aim for 30 – 60 minutes a day. If you have to start with a shorter regimen, that's fine! If you haven't exercised in a long time, 10 minutes might be sufficient to start with. Just keep increasing your time — try staying on the bike five minutes longer each week. 2. Vary resistance and speed. Your bike's settings may be altered as many times during your workout as you wish. Generally, you should start at a lower speed with less resistance, and increase your effort as you get accustomed to the bike. Toggle between levels of difficulty for a more intense interval workout. Bike speed is usually measured in RPM, revolutions per minute. If you're a beginner, try setting your bike at an average of 60 RPM. With more experience, your average should be more like 80 or 100 RPM. When interval training, try switching between about 50 RPM and 100 RPM. (You should not go above 110 RPM — increase resistance instead if you need more of a challenge). If you find yourself bouncing in the saddle of your bike, this means you are not in control of your pedal stroke and you are going too fast. If you are at a high RPM with too little resistance, your pedals are turning because of the momentum of the weighted flywheel. This means you are not doing the work of pedaling, and you are going at an unsafe, uncontrolled cadence. Your bike likely has low, medium, and high resistance settings. Resistance mimics the effect of incline, so it feels like you are riding uphill. Start with a low resistance, and move into using the medium and high settings as your muscles develop. When you are comfortable using all settings, do interval trainings where you switch between medium and low, with short bursts of high resistance. 3. Distract yourself cautiously. Listening to music you enjoy can usually help your workout by raising your mood, but other forms of media can potentially slow you down. Watching a highly engaging drama, reading, and texting tend to slow your pace and compromise your posture. If you are reading or watching a screen, make sure it's exactly at eye level so you don't hunch. If you are exercising with a friend, try interval training at the same intervals so you can chat during recovery time. 4. Start with 1:3 or 1:4 interval training. Interval training provides you with the most efficient form of cardiovascular exercise. In interval training, you perform some of your exercise at a high speed, but you mix it up with \"recovery\" periods, during which you continue to work out at a slower pace. For a 1:4 system, you will exercise at a high speed for three minutes, then a moderate \"recovery\" speed for 12 minutes. Fit individuals may start with a 1:2 speed-recovery ratio. For example, if your interval time is three minutes, then bike at a leisurely pace for six minutes. When you're comfortable with this, you might switch to a 1:1 ratio, going fast for three minutes, then slowing down for three minutes. 5. Do a high-intensity workout. Find spin class videos to bike along with online, or find a cycling routine and follow it on your own. It's easy to find examples of high-intensity patterns online, but it can be hard to keep track of them by yourself. Watch the clock, or use a timer. An example routine: warm up for 15 seconds at moderate effort, then pedal hard for 10 seconds, then pedal slowly for one minute. Follow this by pedaling hard for 20 seconds, then pedal slowly for one minute. Next, pedal hard for 30 seconds, then pedal slowly for two minutes. Pedal hard for 10 seconds, standing up on your upright bike if you can. Sit and pedal slowly for two minutes. Pedal hard for 15 seconds, standing up if you can, then sit and pedal slowly for one minute. Pedal hard for 20 seconds, standing, then sit and pedal slowly for two minutes. Ride for another five minutes at the moderate pace you began, then recover at a leisurely pace for a final five minutes. 6. Take a spin class. [3] X Expert Source Melody Sayers, MS, RD, NASM-CPT Registered Dietician & Personal Trainer Expert Interview Check to see if your local gym offers indoor cycling classes. In these classes you will use an upright bike. An instructor will guide you through interval training, urging you to speed up or slow down in order to maximize the efficiency of your workout. Bring earplugs if you're sensitive to noise, as such classes tend to include loud music; however, be sure you let your spin instructor know that you'll be wearing them for safety's sake. Spin classes tend to be about 45 minutes long, and beginners are encouraged to stay on the bike for the full class, but work at their own pace. 7. Vary your exercise routine. Interval training is based on the principle of variety—your body will get more of a workout when you fight inertia; however, you'll fall into a rut if you always exercise the same way, even if that same way is itself various. You're more likely to feel happy and continue exercising if you vary your routine, and less likely to injure yourself. Break up your cycling with other cardio machines, such as stair climbers and ellipticals. Start out with interval training at least once a week, then increase the frequency. Over a period of weeks and months you should also increase the intensity of your intervals. Try other forms of exercise, such as brisk walking, dancing, and swimming. 8. Adjust the seat of your bike. Bring your seat up or down so that it is level with the top of your hipbone. This may be the right height, but you'll need to test it. Mount the bike and put your feet in the pedals. Extend one leg until you have pushed the pedal as far towards the floor as you can. Your knee should still be slightly bent, at approximately a 20 – 30 degree angle. If your knee is bent more than 30 degrees, raise the seat slightly. If your leg is fully extended, lower the seat. Pedal a little. If your pelvis rocks on the seat, lower the seat slightly. Some upright bikes let you move your seat or handlebars forward and backward. Adjust the seat so that the distance between the end of the seat and the middle of the handlebars is that from your elbow to your knuckles. If your knees are not aligned with your ankles when you pedal, or if your arms are not relaxed as you pedal, adjust either the seat or the handlebars. To adjust a recumbent bike, sit in the seat and adjust forwards and backwards until you have one leg extended at a 20 – 30 degree angle. The way you adjust your seat will depend on the model of your bike. Consult your user's manual if you are unsure. 9. Determine your handlebar height. For upright bikes, you'll need to adjust the handlebars so that you can easily reach them. Your arms should be relaxed, and your elbows slightly bent. If you are hunching your back as you pedal, try raising your handlebars until your back is straight. 10. Fasten your foot straps. Sit in your bike seat and place the balls of your feet on the pedals. Adjust the straps so that they grip your foot snugly, but not tightly. Your foot should not slip around within the strap, but it should be able to slide out easily when pulled. Limit ankle movement while you pedal. If you feel that you are pushing or straining your ankles, relax them. Wear your exercise shoes when you make these adjustments. 11. Set the controls on your bike. Your exercise bike will include settings for speed and resistance or incline. Depending on the model, you may also have a set of workout programs, a heart monitor, and other features. Consult your bike manual for instructions specific to your bike's model. Most recumbent bikes offer workout programs. Most bikes will have a \"Settings\" menu that can be accessed from the console. There may be a button that says \"Settings,\" \"Calories,\" and/or \"Menu.\"",

Fit the bike\n\n* **Seat height:** when you sit with heel on the pedal at the bottom, your knee should be just straight; with the ball of your foot on the pedal you’ll have a slight bend (~25–35°).\n* **Fore–aft:** when the crank is at 3 o’clock, your forward knee stacks roughly over the pedal axle.\n* **Handlebars:** level with or slightly above the seat so your back stays neutral.\n\n2. Secure your feet\n\n* Place the **ball of your foot** over the pedal spindle.\n* Tighten straps/clip in; ankles neutral, not pointed.\n\n3. Posture check\n\n* Hinge at hips, **neutral spine**; shoulders down and relaxed.\n* Light grip; elbows soft; core gently braced; eyes forward.\n\n4. Warm-up — 5 to 10 minutes\n\n* Easy resistance, smooth spin.\n* Cadence 80–90 rpm.\n* Effort: **RPE 3–4** (comfortable conversation).\n\n5. Pick a main set (choose one)\n\n* **Steady Endurance:** 20–30 min at **RPE 5–6**, cadence 80–95 rpm.\n* **Intervals (HIIT):** 6 rounds → **1 min hard** (**RPE 8–9**, 95–110 rpm) + **2 min easy** (**RPE 2–3**).\n* **Hill Climbs:** 3–5 rounds → **4–5 min** seated climb (**RPE 7–8**, cadence 60–80 rpm) + **3 min** easy spin.\n* **Tempo:** 10–15 min continuous at **RPE 6–7** between warm-up and cool-down.\n\n6. Technique cues while riding\n\n* Smooth pedal circles; quiet upper body and hips.\n* Breathe rhythmically (e.g., in 3 sec, out 3 sec).\n* Use resistance to control effort, not just cadence.\n\n7. Cool-down — 5 to 10 minutes\n\n* Easy spin **RPE 2–3**; let heart rate drift down.\n* Then stretch: quads, hamstrings, calves, hip flexors (20–30s each).\n\n8. Hydration & safety\n\n* Sip water every 10–15 min; towel off and wipe the bike after.\n* Stop if you feel pain, dizziness, or chest discomfort.\n\n9. Frequency & progression\n\n* Aim for **3–5 sessions/week**.\n* Progress gradually: add ~5–10% time or +1 interval weekly; take an easier week every 3–4 weeks.\n\n10. Quick 20-minute starter plan\n\n* 5 min warm-up → 10 min steady at **RPE 5** → 3 × (30 s hard **RPE 8** + 30 s easy) → 2 min cool-down.\n\nIf you have any medical conditions or you’re brand-new to exercise, consider checking with a healthcare professional first.\n\n---\n\nI also created a **separate visual guide** (infographic) with the same steps.\n",

Your knee should have a slight bend at the bottom of the pedal stroke.\n\n2.  **Warm-up (5-10 minutes):** Begin with a light resistance and a moderate pace to get your muscles ready.\n3.  **Increase Resistance and Pace (20-30 minutes):** Gradually increase the resistance to a level where you feel challenged but can maintain a steady rhythm. Aim for a pace that elevates your heart rate.\n\n4.  **Incorporate Intervals (Optional):** For a more intense workout, try interval training. Alternate between periods of high intensity (higher resistance and faster pace) and periods of lower intensity (moderate resistance and pace).\n\n5.  **Maintain Good Posture:** Keep your back straight, shoulders relaxed, and engage your core throughout the workout. Avoid hunching over the handlebars.\n\n6.  **Cool-down (5-10 minutes):** Reduce your resistance and pace for the last 5-10 minutes of your workout. This helps your heart rate return to normal and prevents muscle soreness.\n\n7.  **Stretch (5 minutes):** After getting off the bike, perform some light stretches focusing on your hamstrings, quadriceps, and glutes.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Get the right glove. Your glove becomes an extension of your hand when catching a baseball. It must fit your hand properly to work efficiently. As a general rule of thumb, players under the age of 12 will use a glove in the 10–11 inch (25.4–27.9 cm) range. Older players will use something between 11 and 13 inch glove. Before playing regularly with your glove, it’s important to beak in your glove. One of the best ways to break in your glove is by practicing your catch. [1] X Expert Source Isaac Hess Baseball Coach & Instructor Expert Interview 2. Position your body. Catching a baseball relies heavily on your stance and body position. You should be in the athletic position to prepare catching a ball. The athletic position takes the following into effect: Bend your knees slightly. This will give you the flexibility to lung for the ball and keep your mind focused. Keep your shoulders positioned towards the target. This will make it easier to visualize and react once the ball comes towards you. Stand on the balls of your feet instead of standing flat-footed. 3. Watch the ball. The key to catching a baseball is to never let the ball out of your sight. Keep your eyes fixed from the time the ball leaves the thrower's hand until it lands in your glove. By watching the ball, you can track the ball’s flight plan, and prepare for the right stance to catch the ball. ”You can’t catch what you can’t see,” meaning it'll be difficult to catch the ball if your eye is off the ball. 4. Go to the ball. Don’t feel inclined to stay anchored in one place, but instead move to catch the ball. If the ball is thrown and you can tell it will land behind you, run backwards while watching the ball. In baseball, catchers play by zone defense. When the ball enters your zone, it’s your job to move to it. 5. Position your glove. Hold your glove with your palm facing outwards in front of your body. Position the glove in the direction of the target who is throwing the ball. If the ball is thrown above your belly button, you can use this stance to catch the ball with little adjustment. If the throw is below your belly button, rotate your glove so that your fingers are pointed down. When the ball is thrown above your body, use the first position mentioned, but extend your arm upwards. 6. Catch the baseball. Catch the ball in the pocket of the glove. The pocket is another name for the palm of the glove. Close your hand immediately once the ball makes contact with your glove. Get into the practice of using your second hand to secure the catch. Using your second hand will also prepare you to throw once you become a catcher. Your free hand needs to have quick access to the ball. 7. Keep your vision clear. Be careful not to obstruct your vision with your glove when going for the catch. If a ball is heading towards your face, move your glove to the position at the last second. This might take some practice, but the goal is to watch the ball till the final second. Practice throwing with a friend to avoid a black eye on game day. You can usually reposition yourself to avoid your face crossing the ball’s flight path.",

Use two hands\n   • As the ball hits the pocket, cover it with your throwing hand immediately.\n\n6. Funnel to your chest\n   • Bring the glove to the center of your body to secure it and prepare a throw or tag.\n\n7. Communicate & position\n   • For fly balls say “Mine!” and take priority if you have the easier angle. Avoid backpedaling—turn and run to the spot, then get set.\n\n8. Bare-hand (only on soft tosses/foul balls in the stands)\n   • Keep fingers together, elbows slightly bent, and **give** with the ball. Avoid trying to bare-hand hard line drives.\n\n9.

    "text_ref": "1. Stand in the batter’s box. If you are right-handed, stand in the box on the left side of home plate when facing the pitcher, so that you are on the third-base side of home plate. If you are left-handed, opt for the right, on the first-base side. Face home plate. Touch the far side of home plate with the end of your bat. Back up until your arm is fully extended. Feel free to experiment with standing on each side of the box. Some right-handed hitters prefer standing on the right side of home plate, and vice versa with left-handed hitters. Don’t stand too close or too far from the plate. Standing too far away will make it much more difficult to hit outside pitches. Crowding the plate will do the same with inside pitches. If you are a beginner, start by standing directly across from the plate. After a lot of practice in this position, experiment with moving up toward the front of the box or further back, which may make it easier to hit certain pitches. Hitting from the rear of the box, for example, will provide extra time for you to hit a fastball. 2. Determine which of your eyes is dominant. Place any object (a batting tee, a fellow player, etc.) roughly 20 feet away from you (6 meters). Stick your arm straight out in front of you. With both eyes open, raise your thumb into a thumbs-up so that it blocks the object from view. Shut one eye. If your view remains the same, open that eye and shut the other. Whichever eye is suddenly able to see the object is your dominant eye. Right-handed people often have a dominant right eye. Left-handed people typically have a dominant left eye. Determining which eye is dominant will help you choose the best stance to adopt at the plate. 3. Choose your stance. Pick between the neutral, open, and closed stances. Base your decision partly on whichever one makes it easier to keep your dominant eye on the ball. Also consider how the placement of your feet in each position affects your swing. In addition, you may need to adjust your stance based on whether the pitcher is throwing fast or slow. [4] X Expert Source Isaac Hess Baseball Coach & Instructor Expert Interview Regardless of which one you choose, bend your knees a little. Point your toes toward the plate with your feet spread to shoulder-width or a few inches wider. Neutral stance (also called \"even stance\") : Both feet are placed an equal distance from home plate. This is the most popular stance, since it allows you to turn your head over your shoulder without any strain so you can face the pitcher and keep both eyes on the ball. Open stance : The foot closest to the pitcher is moved slightly back so that the front of your body is a little more “open” to the pitcher. This is the least popular stance because it takes you out of hitting position, thus creating extra steps to get back into position during the pitch. Closed stance : The foot closest to the pitcher is placed a tiny bit forward. This stance allows you to cover more of the plate with your bat. However, turning your head to keep both eyes on the pitcher may be more of a strain. If pointing your forward foot toward home plate proves to be uncomfortable, try adjusting it so that your toes point 45 degrees more toward the pitcher. 4. Hold your bat correctly. Cradle the grip in the middle of your fingers instead of your palms. If you are right-handed, grip the bat with your left fingers an inch or two above the very bottom. Then place your right fingers above your left. Extend your arms in front of you as if you just took a swing. Make sure the palm of your left hand is facing downward and the palm of your right is facing up. If you are left-handed, do the reverse. Keep a secure grip on the bat, but also keep your grip loose enough so that your muscles are relaxed. Adjust your grip so that the second knuckles of both hands form a perfect line. 5. Raise the bat. Keep your shoulders in a straight line pointed toward the pitcher. Bend both elbows. Draw your rear elbow up and back until it is level with your rear shoulder and pointing directly behind you. Keep both elbows roughly six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm) away from you. Angle the bat 45 degrees over your rear shoulder. Resting the bat on your shoulder or holding it horizontally will weaken your swing. Holding the bat vertically can create a more powerful swing, but may be uncomfortable for beginners. Make sure you're using the right bat size. If you're using a bat that's too heavy, you won't be able to swing through the zone. [8] X Expert Source Isaac Hess Baseball Coach & Instructor Expert Interview 6. Watch the ball. Turn your head toward the pitcher over your front shoulder. Keep your head still and straight, without cocking it to one side. Focus with both eyes on the ball from the moment it leaves the pitcher’s hand to the instant you make contact with the bat. Practice how to swing a baseball bat as much as you can before going to bat in a game. Train until the swing comes naturally, without you having to think about every little step. This way you are better equipped to concentrate on the ball with your full attention, instead of also having to plot out what to do next. 7. Load and stride. Imagine that you are the hammer to a pistol aimed at the pitcher. Now imagine that you are being cocked to fire as the ball approaches. Move your body’s weight to your rear leg until your rear knee and shoulder are aligned (this is the “load”). Now raise your front foot and take a short step toward the pitcher (this is the “stride”). Keep your stride short so that your body’s weight can shift more easily from your rear leg to your front leg once you begin to swing. 8. Keep your front leg stable. Plant your front foot in place and keep it there throughout your swing. Bend your knee a little if keeping it straight proves to be uncomfortable. Use this leg to prevent yourself from spilling forward with the forward momentum created by your swing. Moving your front foot during your swing will cause you to swing a slower bat. Having an unstable front leg will also make it harder for you to keep your head still. 9. Raise your back heel. As you begin your swing, stand on your back toes. Let the weight of your body shift to your front leg, in the ball’s direction, to add more power to your swing. Ensure that all of your swing’s momentum is aimed directly at the ball. The position of your feet should ultimately form a triangle, with your head as its point. The sides between your head and each foot should be relatively equal. This gives you near perfect balance. 10. Swing with your hips. Use your whole body to swing the bat, not just your arms. As you begin your swing, lead with your rear hip and then follow through with your arms and hands. Keep your elbows bent and tucked in as close to your sides as you can. Pivot on your back toes as you swing, so they end up pointing toward the pitcher. The closer you keep the bat to your body, the more power you can deliver with your swing. 11. Hit the ball. As you bring your bat down from its starting position, aim to keep it parallel to the ground. At the same time, bring it level to the ball’s plane of trajectory. Time your movements so that you hit the ball at the precise moment when your rear hip and shoulder have swung forward to the point that your upper torso is now squarely facing the pitcher. Aim to hit the ball with your bat’s “sweet spot,” roughly five to seven inches from the top of the bat. Keeping the bat parallel to the ground and level with the ball will better ensure that you still hit the ball even if you miss it with the bat’s sweet spot. 12. Swing through the ball. Aim to hit the ball when your swing is at its most powerful. Ensure this by swinging “through the ball” (also called “following through”). Instead of swinging the bat just far enough to make contact with the ball, wait until you have actually hit it before you quit adding force to your swing. Then let the bat slow down as it crosses in front your chest. Your swing should begin with your chin facing your front shoulder. Without moving your head, your chin should then face your rear shoulder by the end of your swing as you follow through. Think of a sprinter crossing a finish line. They don’t slow down and come to a dead stop right at the finish line. They sprint at full speed straight through it. Only then do they slow down bit by bit until they finally stop well past the finish line.",

    "GPT_text": "Here are the two parts you asked for—separate visuals and text.\n\n# Visual steps\n\n(Infographic generated above.)\n\n# Text steps\n\n1. Stance\n\n* Feet a little wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly open toward the pitcher.\n* Knees soft, weight balanced over the balls of your feet.\n* Bat rests on your back shoulder; hands relaxed.\n\n2. Grip\n\n* Line up (or nearly line up) your knocking knuckles.\n* Hold the handle in your fingers, not the palms.\n* Top hand lightly over the bottom; keep wrists loose.\n\n3. Set position\n\n* Bat up and back, knob roughly pointing at your rear hip.\n* Front shoulder slightly closed to the pitcher; elbows comfortable (not flared).\n* Head level, eyes on the pitcher.\n\n4. Load\n\n* As the pitcher begins motion, coil: small rear-hip turn and tiny hand move back.\n* Keep weight mostly on the back leg without swaying.\n\n5. Stride\n\n* Take a short, controlled step straight toward the pitcher (about 2–4 inches).\n* Land softly on the ball of the front foot with it slightly closed; keep head still.\n\n6. Launch (start the swing)\n\n* Rotate from the ground up: back knee drives toward the pitcher, hips open, then torso follows.\n* Hands stay close to the body; knob of the bat starts toward the ball.\n\n7. Swing path\n\n* Keep the barrel on a slightly upward, inside-the-ball path through the hitting zone.\n* Lead with the knob, then let the barrel whip through—don’t “cast” it away from you.\n\n8. Head & eyes\n\n* Track the ball to the contact point; keep your head quiet.\n* Think “see it early, hit it late” (deep contact).\n\n9. Contact\n\n* Front leg firm, back heel released/coming up.\n* Barrel square to the pitch:\n\n  * Low pitch → contact out front of the front hip.\n  * Middle pitch → off the front foot.\n  * High pitch → slightly deeper (closer to your body).\n* Hands slightly in front of the barrel at contact for line drives.\n\n10. Extension\n\n* After contact, extend the arms through the ball along the pitch’s line.\n* Keep the barrel in the zone as long as possible.\n\n11. Follow-through\n\n* Let the hips and shoulders finish; chest faces the field.\n* Finish balanced on your back toe with the bat wrapping naturally around your shoulder.\n\n12. Reset\n\n* Re-center your stance and breathing; prepare for the next pitch.\n\n## Quick cues\n\n* “Balanced, quiet head.”\n* “Short stride, big turn.”\n* “Knob to ball, barrel through.”\n* “Finish tall and balanced.”\n\n## Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Over-striding or stepping open (pulls the head and front shoulder off).\n* Casting the barrel early (weak, around-the-ball swing).\n* Dropping the back shoulder too much (pop-ups).\n* Gripping too tight (slows bat speed).\n* Lunging forward (loses power and vision).\n\n## Safety & setup\n\n* Wear a helmet; use an appropriate bat for your size.\n* Warm up your shoulders, wrists, and hips.\n* Check surroundings (cage, on-deck circle) before swinging.\n\nWant variations for different pitch locations or drills to practice each step?",

Your front shoulder should point towards the pitcher. Hold the bat back, with your hands together and your elbows away from your body. **Step 2: The Load**\nAs the pitcher begins their wind-up, shift your weight back onto your back leg. Bring the bat slightly further back, and gently lift your front foot. This motion is called the \"load\" and helps generate power. **Step 3: The Stride**\nAs the pitch approaches, take a short stride forward with your front foot. Your front heel should land just before you begin your swing. This stride helps transfer your weight from your back leg to your front leg, adding to the power of your swing. **Step 4: The Swing**\nUncoil your body, rotating your hips and shoulders towards the pitcher. Bring the bat through the hitting zone, aiming to make contact slightly in front of your body. Keep your eyes on the ball throughout the swing. **Step 5: Contact and Follow Through**\nMake solid contact with the ball, extending your arms fully. After contact, continue your swing in a fluid motion, letting the bat wrap around your body. This \"follow-through\" ensures maximum power and helps guide the ball. ",

    "text_ref": "1. Lie flat on your back. Try to do this exercise on a padded floor or lay out an exercise mat so you’re a little more comfortable. Lie down on your back and look straight up toward the ceiling. Keep your arms at your sides so your palms are flat against the floor to help stabilize your body during the exercise. 2. Place your calves on top of the exercise ball. Lift your legs up and roll an exercise ball underneath them. Position the middle of your calves on top of the ball so you’re bending at the hips. Make sure you keep your lower back flat against the floor. Leave some room between your thighs and the ball so you can properly perform the exercise. The exercise ball adds more resistance to the exercise so you develop better body control. [4] X Expert Source Landis Owens Personal Trainer Expert Interview If you want to work your core even harder, only rest your feet on top of the exercise ball instead. Get an exercise ball that’s the proper size for your body. If you’re between 5’1”–5’7” (155–170 cm), get a 21 in (53 cm) ball. If you’re 5’8”–6’1” (173–185 cm), then get a ball that’s 25.5 in (65 cm). For people 6’1” (188 cm) or taller, get a 29.5 in (75 cm) ball. [5] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source 3. Lift your hips until your back and legs form a straight line. Take a deep breath in as you tighten your core muscles and your glutes. Press your legs into the exercise ball and slowly lift your hips off of the floor. Keep your head, arms, and shoulder blades against the floor. When your back makes a straight line with your thighs, stop and maintain your position. Breathe freely the whole time you’re performing the exercise so you don’t hold your breath. [7] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source The exercise ball makes you less stable, so you engage your core and glute muscles even more to hold still. Make sure you go slowly when you’re first starting off so the ball doesn’t slip out or roll away. 4. Hold your position for 3 deep breaths. Slowly take 3 deep breaths in and out and try to keep your body straight. Avoid letting your hips sag or arching your back since it could cause you to strain your muscles. [8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Even though you can use your arms to help stabilize yourself, don’t use them to completely balance yourself. Otherwise, you won’t work your core as much. 5. Lower your hips back to your starting position. Using a slow and controlled motion, relax your muscles and drop your glutes back onto the floor. Try to keep the ball as still as possible as you lower your hips. Take a short rest between your reps so you don’t feel too fatigued. [9] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source 6. Complete 3 sets that are each 10 reps for a full workout. During your first set, aim to do 10 full reps of your exercise, but don’t get discouraged if that’s too difficult. Even aiming for 5 reps is a great start. Take a short break between your sets so your muscles have a chance to relax before starting your next one. You should start to feel fatigued by the end of your last set, so don’t push yourself if you’re in pain or struggling to complete all your reps. 7. Lift your arms off the floor to engage your core more. If you’re looking for an easy way to build your core muscles, try raising your arms 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) off of the floor or crossing them over your chest. Since you can’t press into the floor with your palms to stabilize yourself, your abs will work a lot harder to keep your body stable. 8. Lift 1 leg off of the ball to make the exercise more intense. If regular bridges start feeling too easy, try balancing on a single leg instead. Lie on the floor with the ball underneath your legs. Raise your left leg 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) off of the ball and try lifting your hips off the floor to get into the bridge position. Hold the pose for about 3 counts before lowering yourself back down. [13] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Alternate your legs after each rep so you work both sides evenly. 9. Roll the ball closer to you with your feet to work your core and hamstrings. Tighten your core muscles and glutes and push your hips up to straighten your back like you’re doing a regular bridge. Dig your heels into the ball and engage your hamstrings to roll the ball until your knees are bent to 90-degree angles. Hold your position for 3 counts before slowly rolling the ball back to the starting position and lowering your hips. [14] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Try starting with your heels on the ball instead of your calves so it’s more of a challenge lifting your hips.",

    "text_ref": "1. Step up to more intense cardio if you’re able to do stair sprints. This one’s pretty straightforward: run up the stairs as fast as you can, walk briskly (or jog) back down, then run back up again. Keep going up as fast as you can for as long as you can—this may only be for 1-2 minutes or even less. Stay loose during a 1-2 minute break and then do 1 or 2 more sets of sprints. [1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Sprinting up the stairs really gets your heart pumping. Keep in mind that this can be dangerous if you’re not yet in shape for such an intense workout. Use caution and increase your speed gradually—you don't want to risk either a cardiac episode or an injury due to a fall. [2] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview To help keep your pace, pump your arms back and forth. This helps keep you going and works your body harder. Avoid taking the stairs two at a time while doing stair sprints unless you feel really comfortable and safe doing so. Also, avoid this exercise if you have knee problems. 2. Hop up step by step with one or both feet—but be careful. Hopping or jumping up stairs is a plyometric exercise that also gets your heart pumping as a great form of cardio. Start by facing the stairs with your feet on the floor or bottom step. Bend your knees slightly and push yourself off the ground so that you land cleanly and safely on the next step up. Continue this all the way up the flight of stairs. Stair jumping is a great workout, but there’s a definite risk of slipping and falling if you don’t have great balance and aren’t in good physical condition. Don’t do this exercise if you have shallow steps. Your whole foot needs to be able to land flat on each stair tread and not hang off the edge. Some people do one-leg hops for an even more intense workout, but keep in mind that the risk factor is even higher. 3. Stair lunges are a great strength training exercise for your legs and glutes. Start your lunges by standing at the bottom of the stairs. Step your right foot up 2 or 3 stairs, making sure to stretch but not overstrain your leg muscles. Focus on pulling yourself up the stairs using your right leg—if you’re doing it correctly, you’ll really feel it in your thigh muscles! Bring your left leg up to meet your right leg on the step. Start with your left foot for the next lunge and keep alternating. Aim for 10 lunges per side or do as many as you can. Stair lunges can be hard on your knees. If forward lunges cause you knee discomfort, try doing reverse (or backward) lunges going down the stairs. [3] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 4. Target your inner and outer thighs with this complement to lunges. Start by standing at the bottom step with the right side of your body pointed towards the stairs. Take a side step up to the first stair with your right leg, then bring your left leg up beside your right. Repeat this until you get to the top of the stairs, then walk down and do it again, this time leading with your left leg. Don’t do this exercise if the stair treads aren’t deep enough to fit both of your feet side-by-side. Try alternating sets of forward lunges, backward lunges, and side lunges. You’ll definitely feel the burn! 5. Tone your calves by lifting up on your toes at the edge of the step. Calf raises really make your calves pop by targeting your gastrocnemius muscles. Here’s how to do them: Start by standing with both feet on the edge of the bottom step. Only about the front 1/4 to 1/3 of each foot should be on the step; your heels should be hanging off the edge. Rise up on your toes as high as you can. Keep your back, legs, and feet straight, and don't allow yourself to lean forward or backwards. Hold the calf raise for 5-10 seconds, then lower back down and repeat 10-20 times. Take a 1-2 minute break and do a second set if desired. Keep at least one hand on the banister or handrail if balance is a concern. Try doing this on one leg for an even more effective exercise, but only if you have handrails on both sides to support your balance. 6. Work your arms, chest, and core with incline and decline push-ups. Push-ups are a terrific strength training exercise, and using the stairs takes them up another notch! Try doing 2-3 sets of 10-20 repetitions of both incline and decline push-ups with the following technique: [4] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview Face the stairs and place your hands on the first step (for a greater challenge) or second step (for an easier push-up). Keep your arms straight without locking your elbows and extend your legs straight behind you. While keeping your hands shoulder-width apart, slowly bend your elbows so that your upper body and face slowly lower down towards the step. Lower down until your nose is almost touching the step. Pause in this position for at least 1 second, then slowly push yourself back up to the starting position. When you’re done with a set of incline push-ups, do a set of decline push-ups by placing your feet on the bottom or second step and your hands on the floor at ground level. 7. Mix and match several stair-based cardio exercises in a single session. Doing one stair-based cardio exercise for 10, 20, or even 30 minutes may get physically tiring or just plain boring, so don’t be afraid to mix things up by creating your own interval training routine. The simplest form of interval training involves alternating between going up and down the steps at moderate pace and at your fastest pace, each for about 1-2 minutes at a time. But feel free to piece together your own interval training program with a variety of stair-based exercises. Do a 5 minute warmup, such as by slowly walking up and down the stairs, and finish with a 5 minute cool-down. Sprinkle in 1-2 minute rest periods during your session as well. Here’s a sample interval session after your warmup: do 5 minutes of jogging up the stairs, 1 minute of sprints, and 5 more minutes of jogging, then rest for 2 minutes. Also add in stair jumps and hops between the intervals to really get your heart pumping. Then walk for 1-2 minutes and repeat the routine. 8. Go up and down the stairs for 5-10 minutes at a time. It’s no joke—walking up the stairs can be a serious workout! While a long stretch of stairs, such as at a sports stadium or office building, is great for this, your home staircase is more than suitable. Simply walk or jog the stairs for 5-10 minutes, or as long as you can manage. Take a 5 minute break and do a little walking, stretching, or strength training, then hit the stairs again for 5-10 minutes. Do it all again one more time if you wish. Power-walking or jogging up the stairs will get your heart pumping and elevate your breathing rate—which makes it the kind of moderate intensity aerobic exercise that health experts recommend you do for at least 150 minutes each week. 9. Walk up the stairs briskly, covering 2 or more stairs with each step. Walking up stairs is a great workout, but you can make it more challenging! Try lengthening your stride and skipping as many stairs as you safely and comfortably can with each step. Long strides work your leg muscles more than just walking on the stairs—especially the muscles in the back of your legs. [5] X Expert Source Brendon Rearick Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview Walk down the steps normally, then take long strides back up the stairs. Repeat this for around 5-10 minutes if you can manage it, take a short break, and then do another 5-10 minutes if you can. You may be able to cover 4 stairs with each step if you have long legs, but don’t be surprised if you’re in the 2-3 step range. 10. Take the stairs more often as you go through your daily routine. Stairs are a great form of exercise because they’re something you already use regularly. That said, look for little ways to take the stairs even more often. For example, at home, make multiple trips to bring items upstairs or downstairs so you get more exercise—and not just because you keep forgetting to take things with you! Also find ways to use stairs more often when you’re away from home: take the stairs to your office instead of the elevator, or park higher up in the parking garage so you have more stairs to climb on your way out. Exercise is exercise, whether it’s a structured routine or an unstructured “lifestyle activity” like walking up the stairs. Studies have shown that lifestyle activities can be as beneficial to your health as aerobic exercise routines.",

Lead with the inside foot up, drive hips back slightly, then bring the trail foot up. Step down the way you came.\n   * **Easier:** use the lowest step.\n   * **Harder:** pause for 1 second balanced at the top.\n\n4. **Incline Push-Ups — 2 sets of 8–12**\n\n   * Hands on a step (higher step = easier). Body in a straight line, elbows at ~45°. Lower chest toward the step; press back.\n   * **Easier:** move hands to a higher step.\n   * **Harder:** move to a lower step.\n\n5. **Incline Plank Step Taps — 2 sets of 20 alternating taps**\n\n   * Hands on a step in a strong plank. Lift one hand to tap the next higher step, place it back, then switch. Keep hips steady.\n   * **Easier:** widen your stance.\n   * **Harder:** slower tempo or tap two steps up.\n\n6. **Calf Raises — 2 sets of 12–15**\n\n   * Stand on the edge of a step holding the railing lightly. Drop heels slightly below the step, then rise onto the balls of your feet and pause.\n   * **Easier:** both feet.\n   * **Harder:** single-leg.\n\n7. **Toe Taps (Cardio) — 3 rounds of 30–45 sec, 15 sec rest**\n\n   * Rapidly tap the bottom step with alternating feet. Stay light and upright.\n   * **Easier:** slower pace.\n   * **Harder:** pump arms or extend to 60 sec.\n\n8. **Cool-Down (2–3 minutes)**\n\n   * **Calf stretch:** hands on rail, heel down on bottom step, 20–30 sec/side.\n   * **Quad stretch:** stand tall, hold the rail, pull heel to glute, 20–30 sec/side.\n   * **Hamstring stretch:** heel on step, hip hinge with flat back, 20–30 sec/side. Breathe slowly.\n\n# How to structure it\n\n* Do steps **2–7** as a circuit; rest **30–45 sec** between moves.\n* Complete **2–3 circuits** depending on time/fitness.\n\n# Form cues to remember\n\n* Tall chest, ribs down, and brace your core before stepping.\n* Knee tracks roughly over the second/third toe.\n* Move quietly—control down as much as up.\n* Stop if you feel sharp pain or dizziness; consult a pro if you have heart, balance, or joint concerns.\n\nIf you want, tell me your space (number/height of steps and any equipment) and I can tailor reps, progressions, and a weekly plan.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Hold the club with a secure, natural grip . The pinky of your non-dominant hand, or top hand, should curl just below the end of the club. Place your dominant hand, or bottom hand, just below your top hand. Keep the club in the creases between your palms and fingers instead of in the middle of your palms. For your bottom hand, your ring and pinky fingers should grip the club with the most pressure. For your top hand, your index finger should make contact with the most pressure. Your grip should be loose but well-controlled. Grip the club tightly enough to keep it secure in your hands, but keep your hands free of tension. Try to keep your hands about a fist or fist and a half away from your thighs. [2] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview 2. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and knees slightly bent. Your non-dominant foot should be in front, or closer to the target. Position your back foot perpendicular to the target, and point your front toe slightly toward the target. Distribute your weight evenly on each foot, and keep your weight on the balls of your feet. Center the ball between your feet. The ball should be far enough away from your feet that your arms can hang straight down comfortably. If you have to reach, you’re too far away. If you have to hold your arms close to your body, you’re too close to the ball. 3. Bend forward from your hips about 35 to 40 degrees. Bend over from your hips so your arms can hang down comfortably. Imagine a clock face; the angle between 12 o’clock and 3 o’clock is 90 degrees. To bend at the correct angle, your back should be just past 1 o’clock, or around the 6 minute mark. Try looking at yourself in a mirror to gauge the angle of your hip bend. A good hip bend will allow you to rotate your hips and power your swing. 4. Square your shoulders, hips, knees, and feet with the ball. Your body, the ball, and the target should all be parallel. Imagine you’re standing on train tracks. Your feet should be on 1 rail, and the ball should be on the other. 5. Shift your weight back as you rotate your hips and torso. Begin your backswing by gradually shifting your weight to your back foot. Just before you start rotating your body, raise your arms back slightly in a straight line. In a single, continuous motion, rotate your arms, shoulders, and hips backward. Make sure that you're rotating your chest instead of your arms as you take the club back. [7] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview Keep your arms fully extended as you rotate into your backswing. Once your club is around shoulder height, bend your wrists to hinge your hands and raise the club up higher. This will help you generate a more powerful swing. To drive the ball and make mid-distance shots, you’ll rotate fully into the backswing with the club raised above your head. You’ll make adjustments when the time comes to putt, since you won’t need to generate as much force. 6. Tilt your front shoulder downward at the top of your backswing. Instead of turning your shoulders at a level plane, your front shoulder should be tucked down slightly. Additionally, tuck your front shoulder into your chin, keep your eye on the ball, and maintain the bend from your hips. When you start to transition from your backswing to the downswing, it should feel like your front shoulder is moving toward the ground. 7. Lead your downswing rotation with your front hip. Begin the downswing by shifting your weight to your front foot as you turn your front hip toward the target. Leading with your front hip, quickly rotate your body toward the target. When you're swinging a driver, the downswing sequence is hips, thorax, arms, and shaft. [10] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview Your body is like a spring that gathers energy with the backswing and releases it in the downswing. The downswing should be fully committed, smooth, swift, and free of hesitation. Keep your eye on the ball throughout your swing. 8. Return to your squared starting position at impact. The moment you strike the ball, your hips, feet, arms, and shoulders should all be back to the starting position and square with the ball. Your weight should be on your front foot, but your back foot should still be planted firmly on the ground. Bump your hip up toward your target when you make contact with the ball. Your front shoulder should be tilted up slightly, and your torso should be extended (but still bent from the hips) instead of hunched. 9. Continue the rotation into a long, tall follow-through. After striking the ball, turn your hips, arms, and torso in a continuous motion toward the target. As you turn, rotate your back foot so your toes point toward the target. Bring your arms across your chest to finish the swing with your club held just above your leading shoulder. Though shoulders and hips are rotated, you should be standing up tall with your chest out and torso extended. In your final position, your body should be long and tall with your head held up instead of hunched over. Your legs should be extended, your front foot should still be perpendicular to the target, and your chest should face toward the target.",

    "GPT_text": "Here are the **text steps** (separate from the visual):\n\n# How to Hit a Golf Ball (Beginner Step-By-Step)\n\n1. Grip (Neutral)\n\n* Lead hand first: place the club diagonally across the fingers, pad of the palm on top.\n* Wrap trail hand so the “V” between thumb and index on both hands points between your trail shoulder and chin.\n* Light–medium pressure (about 5/10). You should be able to waggle the club.\n\n2. Athletic Setup\n\n* Feet shoulder-width (narrower for short clubs, wider for driver).\n* Tilt from the hips, back flat, slight knee flex, arms hang naturally.\n* Weight balanced over laces, not on heels or toes.\n\n3. Aim & Alignment\n\n* Aim the clubface at a mini target a foot in front of the ball on your target line.\n* Set feet/hips/shoulders parallel to that line (like train tracks).\n* Check that the clubface—not your body—is what points at the target.\n\n4. Ball Position\n\n* Wedges/short irons: middle of stance.\n* Mid-irons: one ball forward of center.\n* Long irons/hybrids: two balls forward of center.\n* Driver: just inside lead heel.\n* Shaft slightly leaning toward target for irons; neutral for driver.\n\n5. Takeaway (First 2 feet)\n\n* One-piece move: chest, arms, and club start together.\n* Clubhead stays outside your hands; low and slow.\n* Keep the triangle formed by your arms and chest.\n\n6. Backswing to the Top\n\n* Turn your shoulders under your chin; let hips rotate naturally.\n* Lead arm across chest (not jammed behind you).\n* Hinge wrists so the club points roughly over your trail shoulder; weight loads into the inside of your trail foot.\n\n7. Start the Downswing\n\n* Sequence from the ground up: shift/rotate hips toward the target, then torso, then arms, then club.\n* Keep your head steady; let the club shallow (shaft slightly more horizontal).\n* Hands ahead of the ball with irons at impact; brush the turf after the ball.\n\n8. Strike & Finish\n\n* For irons: ball-then-turf; divot in front of where the ball sat.\n* For driver: sweep upward by teeing the ball so half sits above the crown.\n* Hold a balanced finish with chest facing target, weight on lead foot, trail foot up on toe.\n\n## Quick Checkpoints\n\n* Posture: if someone tugged the club at address, you’d feel stable.\n* Tempo: count “1-2 (backswing), 3 (down)”—smooth, never rushed.\n* Low point: place a line on the ground—your divot should start just past it with irons.\n\n## Mini Drills (2 minutes each)\n\n* **Feet-together swings:** 10 smooth swings for balance and rhythm.\n* **Tee-brush drill (irons):** No ball; clip the ground just past an empty tee.\n* **Gate drill (start line):** Two tees just wider than the clubhead; swing through without hitting them.\n* **Pause drill:** Pause for 1 count at the top, then swing—teaches sequence.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate additional visuals—for example a close-up grip sheet and an alignment overhead—separate from the main poster.\n",

The V-shapes formed by your thumbs and forefingers should point towards your right shoulder.\n*   **Stance:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart for irons, and slightly wider for woods. The ball should be positioned off the heel of your lead foot (left foot for right-handers) for woods, and roughly in the middle of your stance for irons.\n*   **Posture:** Bend from your hips, not your waist, keeping your back relatively straight. Let your arms hang naturally. You should feel balanced and athletic.\n\n\n\n**Step 2: The Takeaway**\n\n*   Start your swing by moving the club, your arms, and your shoulders all together in one piece. This is often called a \"one-piece takeaway.\"\n*   Keep your wrists relatively firm in the initial stage. Avoid letting your wrists \"break\" too early.\n*   The clubhead should move back along the target line initially, before naturally moving slightly inside.\n\n**Step 3: The Backswing**\n\n*   Continue rotating your shoulders and hips away from the target. Your weight will naturally shift to your back foot (right foot for right-handers).\n*   Your wrists will hinge or \"cock\" as you reach the top of your backswing.\n*   Aim for a position where the club is roughly parallel to the ground at the top, pointing towards your target. Don't overswing!\n\n**Step 4: The Downswing**\n\n*   Initiate the downswing by shifting your weight back to your front foot (left foot for right-handers) and rotating your hips towards the target. This is a crucial move for power.\n*   Your arms and the club will follow, dropping down and inside.\n*   Try to feel like you're pulling the club down, rather than hitting with your hands from the top.\n\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Jump with your toes as close to the edge of the board as possible. To maximize your distance, jump with your foot as close to the end of the board as possible. The width of the board is typically 8 inches (0.20 m), and it is legal to jump from any point on this board. This means that a 6 ft (1.8 m) jump from the back of the board would score a full 8 inches (20 cm) farther from the front of the board. That’s a big boost! If you go over the line, your jump is a foul. In most events, you will have 2 more attempts to perform a legal jump. This is particularly important if the board that you’re using is wider than 8 inches (20 cm), since some of your opponents may jump from much further back. 2. Keep your head up when you launch from the board to avoid losing momentum. The tricky part of initiating a jump is that you lose speed if you look down, so keep your head upright and keep the board in your peripheral vision. When planting your foot to take off, keep your eyes on the sand pit in front of you and trust that your foot is planted legally the board. The more jumps that you make, the better you will become at keeping your head up and jumping from a powerful position. It is extremely tempting to look down while you throw your body up into the air. The more you practice jumping, the more you’ll get used to staying upright when you launch. 3. Aim to jump at a 22-degree angle to maximize your flight distance. If the human body were a perfectly round ball, you’d want to jump at a 45-degree angle for a perfect arc. Unfortunately, you aren’t that aerodynamic. Due to the shape of the human body, the optimal take-off angle is around 22 degrees. This is pretty low to the ground. With each jump, aim to propel yourself forward, not straight up. Since you’re in motion and there are rarely reference points to judge your angle, it’s extremely hard to determine what 22 degrees looks like. This comes down more to feel than anything else. At your maximum height, your feet should be roughly where your hips are when you’re standing on the ground. If you can, have someone film you from the side at a competition. This way you can review the footage and determine if you’re jumping too high or too low. 4. Land on your heels and keep your hands and back off of the sand. As your feet slide into the sand, do everything in your power to avoid dropping your hands or butt into the sand behind you. Your jump is scored based on the first break in the sand, not where your feet hit, so if you lean back into the sand you’re actively subtracting from your distance. When landing, do not try to break your fall. The sand will protect you from injury and cushion you as you roll forward. If you watch the professionals, they don’t always look pretty when they land! They often roll forward ungracefully into the sand. This is because the only important part of landing is not falling back, but rolling forward.",

Mark a start point for **12–16 strides** (or 6–8 if you’re newer).\n2. Do 3 runway run-throughs; adjust so your natural sprint hits the board without reaching.\n3. Cue: “**Build, don’t blast**”—accelerate smoothly; tall posture, eyes down the runway.\n\n## 3) The Last Two Strides\n\n4. **Penultimate**: slightly longer, “long–low” step to lower the hips a bit.\n5. **Final**: slightly shorter, “short–quick” step so the foot lands **under the hips**.\n\n## 4) Takeoff\n\n6. Strike the board through the **ball of the foot** (flat, not on the heel).\n7. Drive the **free knee** up; snap the opposite arm; keep chest tall.\n8. Project out at a shallow angle (think **run off the board**, not jump straight up).\n\n## 5) Flight (pick one style)\n\n* **Hang**: extend arms up, legs together; hold a long shape.\n* **Hitch-kick**: cycle the legs (1–1½ quick cycles) to stay balanced.\n\n## 6) Landing\n\n9. As you descend, **shoot both legs forward**, ankles dorsiflexed.\n10. **Heels hit first**; throw arms forward and **pull heels back** on contact so your hips slide past.\n11. Stand/step **forward**, not back, to keep the mark.\n\n## 7) Core Drills (2–3×/week)\n\n* Pop-ups off the board (6–10 reps)\n* Penultimate-to-takeoff repeats (6–8)\n* Bounding (2×20 m)\n* Short-approach sand landings (6–8)\n* Runway run-throughs (6–10)\n\n## 8) Strength & Power (2–3×/week)\n\n* Squat/hex-bar deadlift, RDLs, hip thrusts, step-ups (3–5 sets × 3–6 reps, heavy but crisp).\n* Plyometrics: low-to-moderate contacts (box jumps, low depth drops).\n* Optional if trained: Olympic lifts (cleans/snatches, 3×3–5).\n* Core: anti-rotation presses, hollow holds, side planks.\n\n## 9) Weekly Template (sample)\n\n* **Day 1:** Technique + pop-ups + landings, light lifts.\n* **Day 3:** Speed runs + penultimate drills + plyos.\n* **Day 5:** Full approaches + 3–6 measured jumps, strength lower-body.\n  *(Deload every 4th week: cut jump/plyo volume by ~30–40%.)*\n\n## 10) Common Fixes\n\n* **Reaching for the board:** shorten the approach by 1–2 shoe lengths; keep cadence up.\n* **Stalling upward:** think “drive knee and **go forward**”; keep takeoff foot under hips.\n* **Falling back in sand:** sweep legs late and pull heels back; keep chin up on landing.\n\n## 11) Safety & Prep\n\n* Do this on a proper runway/board with a raked sand pit.\n* Stop if you feel sharp pain; protect shins/Achilles; add rest days as needed.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can also tailor a 4-week progression to your age, best mark, and available days.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Do a Volleyball Serve Jump? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Position yourself. Stand two-three feet behind the back line. You will want to throw the ball high and step to the line in order to gain momentum for your jump. Start with your left foot forward if you are right handed, and your right foot forward if you are left handed. You will take a three step approach. 2. Aim your serve. Look to the positions of the players on the opposing team and try to aim your serve in the empty spaces. You want to hit the ball into “dead zones”. This means that when you hit the ball, you want it to land between players, so that they have to communicate about who will hit the ball back. Position your body so that you are facing one of the dead zones. Turn your hips and shoulders toward the area. You should not have to turn your head to look at it. 3. Toss the ball in the air. To do a float serve, use both hands. To make the ball spin, throw it up with your dominant hand with a topspin. Toss the ball high and in front of you. You should be able to do an approach before you hit the ball, so make sure that you throw it in front of you and high enough, so that it floats just behind the serving line. A good rule is to throw the ball the way that you like the ball to be set to you. If you like your sets low, then throw the ball lower. If you like your sets higher, throw the ball higher. 4. Jump to hit the ball in mid-air. [1] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview Do your regular hitting approach: Slow left step, and then two fast steps: right, left. Do the opposite if you are left handed. Jump with both feet, and hit the ball hard with your dominant hand. Aim your jump so that you remain in the serving area. If you hit the ball when you are outside the service area, the serve will be void. 5. Hit the ball midair. Contact it with as much surface area of your hand as possible, and flick your wrist for a topspin. Hit more with the palm of your hand for a float serve. Hit it as hard as possible. This is where the force and momentum of the jump serve comes from. [3] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview Contact the ball with a fully extended arm and jump high. If you do, the ball should clear the net and land deep. 6. Aim the ball and follow through. When hitting the ball, your eyes should be on the ball. After you've hit it, bring your hitting arm down. Point your hand toward the place that you want the ball to land. [4] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview Follow through with your eyes as well. This will ensure that you focus on the ball from the moment of contact until your follow through. 7. Land your jump. As long as you were behind the service line when you hit the ball, your serve should be legal. However, to be safe, you should try to land behind the service line as well. If you overshoot your landing, you may accidentally hit the ball too close to the court. Land with both feet. Keep your knees bent to avoid any injuries. 8. Prepare eight balls for the drill. Place a pair of balls at four intervals along the court. The first pair should be at the net. The next pair should be three steps back, and the next pair three steps back from that. The final pair should be at the serving line. Placing balls close to the net gives you a good idea of the height you need to extended your jump and your arm in order to get the ball over the net. 9. Hit one ball from each pair over the net. Do not jump to hit the ball. Instead, toss the ball high in the air and swing your arm up to hit it. You should hit the ball when your arm is fully extended. Start with the ball closest to the net and move backwards until you are hitting the ball from the serving line. It is important that you do not jump, so that you get a sense of how long your body and arm should be extended. You want to use the same position when you jump serve, with your arm fully extended. 10. Hit the second ball from each pair over the net. This time, jump when you hit the ball. The first hit, close to the net, should give you an idea of how high you should jump. Each time you hit a ball further away, you should be hitting it a little bit harder. As you get back to the serving line, use everything that you have learned thus far. You should be jumping and fully extending your arm just as you did before you were jumping. You should also be jumping as high as you had to when you were serving close to the net.",

Stance & Setup\n\n* Stand **behind the end line** with feet shoulder-width.\n* Hold the ball in your **non-hitting hand** (left for right-handers). Hitting arm relaxed at your side.\n\n2. Focused Toss\n\n* Toss with your non-hitting hand: **slightly forward into the court** and high enough to reach at full extension.\n* Keep the toss straight and consistent—no spin.\n\n3. Approach\n\n* Use a **3-step approach**: **left–right–left** (right-handers).\n* Stay tall, accelerate smoothly; eyes on the ball.\n\n4. Load (Bow-and-Arrow)\n\n* As you plant the last step, load your legs and core.\n* **Non-hitting arm points up** at the ball; hitting arm draws back (elbow high, hand relaxed).\n\n5. Jump\n\n* **Jump off both feet** from behind the end line.\n* Drive through your hips; keep your chest up and eyes on the ball.\n\n6. Contact\n\n* Reach to **full extension**.\n* Strike the **upper-back/center** of the ball with a firm, open hand.\n* Snap/pronate the wrist through the ball for topspin.\n\n7. Follow-Through\n\n* Arm continues across your body; core stays tight.\n* Keep your shoulders square toward your target.\n\n8. Landing & Finish\n\n* Land on two feet, **balanced and inside the court** (that’s legal as long as you contacted the ball before touching the floor beyond the line).\n* Recover into a ready defensive position.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Tips\n\n* **Legal check:** Do **not** step on/over the end line **before contact**.\n* **Common fixes:**\n\n  * Toss drifts? Slow your toss and keep it in front of your hitting shoulder.\n  * Balls going long? Contact more on the **top** of the ball and add wrist snap.\n  * Netting serves? Toss a bit **higher/forward** and reach fully.\n* **Progressions:** Start with standing serves → add approach steps → then jump serve.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a second image that shows the **left-handed** version or a **target zones** diagram.\n",

    "prompt": "How to do the Superman exercise for lower back? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Lie face down with your arms and legs extended straight. Stretch your arms out in front of you and your legs straight back. Try to make a straight line with your body from your fingers to your toes. Stay relaxed and don’t tense your muscles. This is your starting and rest position for the superman exercise. You’ll be more comfortable if you do this on a soft mat. If you don’t have a mat, a carpet or area rug will work too. 2. Raise your arms and legs as high as you can. Squeeze your glutes and lower back muscles to bend your body up. This raises your arms and legs toward the ceiling. Try to do this in a slow, smooth motion. Imagine trying to make yourself look like Superman in flight, which is where the exercise gets its name. Keep your head in a neutral position during the whole exercise. Continue looking down so you don't have any neck pain. Try to raise your feet and hands to about the same height. Otherwise your body will be unbalanced. If you feel any pain in your back, then you’re probably bending your spine too much. Lower arms and legs a bit to take pressure off your back. 3. Hold the position for 3-5 seconds. When you’ve lifted your arms and legs as much as possible, stay in that position. Count slowly for 3-5 seconds. All your muscles will have to work to keep you stable, giving you a great workout. Tightening your abdominal muscles will help you keep yourself stable. Don’t rush through this exercise. If you move too quickly, you won’t activate all your muscles and you’ll get less benefit. 4. Lower your arms and legs slowly back to the floor. Gradually loosen your glutes and back muscles to lower your arms and legs. Maintain a smooth motion until your arms and legs touch the floor again. Be careful not to drop your arms and legs. Stick with a slow, smooth motion so you're getting the most benefit from this exercise. 5. Repeat 3 sets of 10 reps each. Continue raising and lowering your arms 10 times to complete a set. Rest for 1-2 minutes and do 2 more sets for a full workout. Remember to maintain smooth movements for every rep. If you’re having trouble keeping a good form, then you’re probably getting tired. Take a short rest and try again. You can also do more or fewer reps, depending on how you feel. This isn’t set in stone. 6. Hold your position for 15-30 seconds to get a better workout. While a normal superman rep is only 3-5 seconds, you can give yourself more of a burn by holding it longer. Try to keep your arms and legs raised for 15-30 seconds at a time, or for as long as you can hold them. This is a powerful isometric exercise that trains your back and leg muscles more deeply than a normal superman. Remember to keep your neck in a neutral position while you’re holding. It’s easy to forget about your form when you’re holding exercises for a long time. If you feel like any of your muscles are straining or hyperextending while you’re holding the position, then lower yourself down. You could pull a muscle if you stretch yourself too much, and pulling muscles in your back is no fun at all. 7. Raise just your upper body for an easier exercise. The superman can be a tough exercise, so this variation is perfect if you’re still getting used to it. Get into a normal starting position with your arms stretched in front of you. However, instead of raising your arms and legs, just raise your arms. This puts less stress on your back than a full superman. This could also be a warmup routine before doing regular supermans. 8. Try the alternating superman to train muscles from different angles. Lay in the same starting position, with your face down and arms and legs stretched out straight. Then instead of raising both your arms and legs at the same time, only lift your left arm and right leg and hold them up for 3-5 seconds. Lower them and lift your right arm and left leg. Continue alternating between the two 10-12 times for a full set. This is also a good warm-up activity before doing full supermans. This variation tends to be easier than a normal superman, so it’s a good choice if you’re not ready for full ones yet. 9. Squeeze a medicine ball between your feet during the exercise. This really kicks the strength training into high-gear by adding resistance to the workout. Place a light medicine ball or stability ball between your feet and squeeze. Keep the ball pressed between your feet during the entire workout. Don’t go overboard with the weight. Start off with a very light weight, then increase it slowly so you don’t hurt yourself. It helps to warm up with some regular supermans before doing this variation so your muscles are ready. 10. Work your abs with a reverse superman. This exercise trains your abdominals and obliques instead of your back and legs. Lay on your back instead of your stomach, and stretch your arms back behind your head. Squeeze your core to lift your legs and arms as high as you can without bending your back forward. Lower them back down smoothly to complete a rep. To make this exercise harder, you can hold weights in your hands or squeeze a medicine ball between your feet.",

Try to lift them a few inches, feeling the contraction in your lower back and glutes. Imagine someone pulling your hands forward and your feet backward.\n**Step 3: Hold**\n\nHold this \"flying\" position for 1-2 seconds, maintaining a steady breath. Ensure you're not arching your neck too much; keep your gaze towards the floor.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Warm up, then get into the correct position and form. Compared to a traditional push-up, a pike push-up uses a very different form. It's essential to make sure you get into the correct form to prevent injury. To start a pike push-up, get down into a regular or traditional push-up position. Your feet should be hip width apart and your arms should be shoulder width apart. Start to walk your hands backwards towards your feet. Keep your legs straight as you do this. Stop when your body forms an upside down \"V\" shape and between your torso and legs is a 90 degree angle. This will be your starting and ending position. 2. Bend your elbows to move your head towards the floor. Your elbows should be at a 45 degree angle to your body, meaning they shouldn't be straight out to the sides or pinned against the side of your body. Touch the ground with your head, then slowly push yourself back up to the starting position. This is one pike push-up. Start with as many pike push-ups as you can. Eventually aim for a set of 10-15 reps. As you improve, you can increase the amount of sets you do each time you exercise. Since the shoulders can be a delicate area of muscles, it's important to avoid overdoing it as you can injury yourself. 3. Increase the intensity of a pike push-up. Compared to a traditional push-up, the pike push-up may feel like a higher intensity exercise, especially if you have more upper body mass than lower body mass. However, if you find that you can easily do a pike push-up with little difficulty, there are ways to even increase the intensity and difficulty of this exercise. Begin in the starting position where your body is in an upside down \"V\" shape. Your hands should be shoulder width apart and your legs should be hip width apart. Before lowering your head towards the ground, lift your right leg into the air. It should track in a straight line (or close to it) with your back. With your leg raised, begin your pike push-ups. Bend your elbows out away from your body at a 45 degree angle until your head touches the ground. Slowly push yourself back up to the starting position. Repeat the push-up with your right leg raised 10 times. Then, switch and repeat your pike push-ups with your left leg raised in the air. 4. Stretch it out. Similar to range of motion exercises prior to a workout, it's equally important to stretch out your muscles after a work out. Some studies show this might relieve post workout soreness and help maintain range of motion and flexibility. [2] X Trustworthy Source Harvard Medical School Harvard Medical School's Educational Site for the Public Go to source Try some of these shoulder stretches after your push-up or shoulder exercises: Shoulder blade squeezes. While standing straight, squeeze your shoulder blades together until you feel a light stretch on the front of your shoulders. Hold for 20-30 seconds. Shoulder abduction stretches. Lift your arms straight out to the sides and continue until your fingers are pointing towards the ceiling. You should feel the sides of your shoulders being stretched. Cross body stretch. Bend one arm across your body at chest level. Press your arm into your chest with your free arm until you feel a light stretch in your shoulder. Switch sides. You can also do this across your back, holding the back arm in place with your other hand.",

Setup\n\n* Start in a \"pike\" (down-dog-like) position: hands shoulder-width, fingers spread, arms straight.\n* Walk feet toward hands so hips are stacked high over shoulders; heels can lift. Keep ribs tucked and chin slightly in (gaze toward toes).\n\n2. Brace\n\n* Press the floor away, engage your core and glutes, and keep a straight line from wrists → shoulders → hips.\n\n3. Lower (eccentric)\n\n* Inhale. Bend elbows **back at ~45°** (not flared).\n* Let your head travel **forward between the hands** as you descend; keep hips high.\n\n4. Bottom position\n\n* Stop when the **crown of your head** lightly touches (or hovers above) the floor or a pad.\n* Forearms near vertical; shoulders stacked over hands; torso ~45° to the ground.\n\n5. Press (concentric)\n\n* Exhale. Drive palms into the floor, push shoulders up and back, and extend elbows to return to the start.\n\n6. Tempo & breathing\n\n* 2–3 s down → 1 s pause near bottom → 1–2 s up.\n* Inhale on the way down; exhale as you press up.\n\n7. Reps & sets\n\n* Beginners: 3×6–8 reps.\n* Intermediate: 3–4×8–12. Rest 60–90 s between sets, 2–3×/week.\n\n8. Progressions & regressions\n\n* **Easier:** Bend knees (shortens lever) or place hands on a box/bench.\n* **Harder:** Elevate feet (decline pike); progress to wall-assisted handstand push-ups.\n\n**Form cues:** “Hips high,” “elbows back,” “head forward between hands,” “push the floor away.”\n**Common mistakes:** Hips sagging, elbows flaring, head diving straight down, rushing the tempo, or cutting range short.\n**Safety:** Use a folded towel/yoga block under the head at first; stop if you feel shoulder or neck pain.\n\n---\n\nA **visual step guide** has been generated separately (infographic).

Here's how to do it with proper form:\n\n**Step 1: Starting Position**\nBegin in a downward dog yoga pose. Your hands should be shoulder-width apart, fingers spread, and pointed forward. Your feet should be hip-width apart. Lift your hips high towards the ceiling, keeping your legs and back as straight as possible. Your body should form an inverted 'V' shape. **Step 2: Head Placement**\nBefore initiating the push-up, adjust your head. It should be tucked slightly, with your gaze directed towards your feet or between your hands. This alignment helps ensure your head will move forward, not straight down, as you lower. **Step 3: Lowering Down**\nBend your elbows, keeping them pointing backward and slightly out to the sides. Lower the crown of your head towards the floor, aiming to touch it lightly between or just in front of your hands. Keep your hips elevated throughout the movement, and try to maintain the inverted 'V' shape. **Step 4: Pushing Up**\nOnce your head lightly touches the floor (or as low as you can comfortably go with good form), push through your hands and extend your elbows to return to the starting inverted 'V' position. Focus on using your shoulder and tricep strength to drive the movement. ",

    "text_ref": "1. Hold the ball straight out in front of you so that it is at the height of your chest. Drop it and let it bounce. As the ball begins to descend after this bounce, kick it back up into the air. Try to kick it with your dominant foot hard enough that it reaches chest height. Try to kick the ball with your foot angled slightly upward. Make sure to kick the ball with your laces. Make sure that your laces are not double knotted at first. The ball may bounce off of your laces at a weird angle if your laces are tied in a large knot. If you deflate the soccer ball a little bit, you will reduce the intensity of its bounce. The ball will be easier to control and won’t go flying every time you miss a kick. Once you’ve mastered the technique of juggling, you should fully inflate your ball. Keep your ankle 'locked' so that it stays angled and strong. A wobbly ankle leads to a wobbly kick. 2. Keep your knees slightly bent. Doing this will help you have better control over the ball. Do not lock your knees. Keep the foot you are not kicking with (your controlling foot) flat and firmly planted on the ground. It is important to be balanced while juggling the ball. In between touches, it is risky but useful to try to re-balance yourself such that you can maintain control of how you hit the ball each time. Always try to stay balanced on your toes, ready to make quick movements. The biggest key to balancing is to keep your knees bent and your eyes on the ball. 3. Practice until you can easily and consistently catch the ball in front of your stomach. You should not have to lean or reach to catch the ball. Then do the same with your other foot. Keep in mind that juggling with your non-dominant foot will be harder. Keep at it! 4. Increase the number of times you let the ball bounce off your feet. Instead of catching the ball every time you kick it, kick it up into the air and as it falls, kick it up again rather than letting it bounce on the ground. Try to keep the ball under control. Focus on juggling with one foot until you feel confident, then switch to the other foot. Practice until you feel confident juggling with both feet. You can \"catch\" the ball on your foot with careful practice by cushioning the fall of the ball and holding it in place with your foot and shin.",

First touch (“pop”)\n\n* Drop the ball, let it bounce once.\n* Lift your dominant foot; toes slightly up, ankle locked.\n* Strike the bottom-center with your laces so it rises to about waist height.\n\n3.

Two pops, same foot\n\n* Drop → bounce → pop → bounce → pop → catch.\n* Keep touches light, ball close to your body, tiny hop on your standing foot.\n\n5. Alternate feet with a bounce\n\n* Right foot pop, bounce, left foot pop, bounce, catch.\n* Keep the ball centered between your feet.\n\n6. Continuous (no bounce)\n\n* Pop with one foot and, before it drops too far, pop with the other.\n* Aim for knee-to-waist height; stay balanced with small, light hops.\n\n7. Add thighs\n\n* When the ball rises too high for your feet, cushion and lift with your thigh.\n* Keep knees level; hit the mid-thigh so the ball goes straight up.\n\n8. Mix surfaces & control\n\n* Combine feet and thighs in a rhythm (R foot → L foot → R thigh → L foot, etc.).\n* Keep your torso quiet, eyes on the lower half of the ball, ankle locked on every touch.\n\n9. Build consistency (mini goals)\n\n* 5 touches total → 10 → 20 without moving much from your spot.\n* Then try “weak foot only” sets.\n\n10. Quick fixes for common mistakes\n\n* Ball drifting forward: lean slightly over the ball; strike more under the center.\n* Spinning ball: hit with a firm, flat laces surface; avoid toe-poking.\n* Popping too high: relax and hit lighter; aim for consistent knee-to-waist height.\n* Chasing the ball: take smaller hops and keep it centered between your shoulders.\n\nWant a version that adds heading (forehead) or chest control next?",

Keep your knees slightly bent and your eyes on the ball. It's helpful to have a slightly dominant foot forward, but you'll want to practice with both.\n**Step 2: Drop the Ball**\nHold the soccer ball in your hands at about waist height. Gently drop the ball straight down in front of your dominant foot. Don't throw it up, just let gravity do the work.\n**Step 3: Make Contact**\nAs the ball drops, lift your foot and strike the ball with the top of your shoelaces (the \"laces\" part of your foot). Aim to hit the ball squarely in the middle to give it a good, controlled bounce straight up. Don't kick too hard; just enough to get it back up to your hands or chest height.\n**Step 4: Cushion the Ball**\nAs the ball comes back down, don't just let it hit your foot stiffly. Relax your ankle and \"cushion\" the ball by letting your foot drop slightly as you make contact. This absorbs some of the impact and helps you maintain control.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Throw a Hook in Bowling? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Line up your feet slightly to the left-hand side of the lane. Try to visualize the steps you'll take across the lane when you're throwing the ball. Then, start with your right foot on the middle dot for your approach. Be sure to keep your feet close together to maintain alignment. Depending on the way your ball reacts to different lane conditions, you may need to adjust your foot placement, as needed, as you get comfortable with your hook. [1] X Expert Source Chad McLean Bowling Expert Expert Interview 2. Stand with your heels several inches from the foul line. Take the usual 4-step approach away from the lane to determine your starting position (don't throw the ball yet). Aim to throw your ball at one of the arrows on the lane. The easiest way to aim is to use the arrow markings or the dots that are just before the arrows on the lane. For this tutorial, start off aiming somewhere around the second arrow on the right, allowing the ball to roll over this arrow, move out to only a few boards from the gutter, and then hook from the dry spot of the lane (about 38 to 40 feet down on a house shot) all the way back to the 1-3 pocket. For a left-hander, this would be the 2nd arrow on the left, and the ball would hook to the 1-2 pocket. 3. Hold the bowling ball and use a 4-step approach to throw your hook. To do a basic 4-step approach: Swing the ball forward on your first step, stepping with your right foot first for right-handed players. Line the ball up parallel to your ankle at the second step, and bend at your knees. Be at the top of your backswing by your third step and bring the ball back through and release by the end of your final step. A 4-step approach is recommended, but you can use as little as 1 step and as many as 8 (though most steps over 4 are basically just timing steps where your ball doesn't move). A 5-step approach is basically the same except you start with your left foot instead, and the ball won't move for that first step. Remember not to force the swing; allow gravity to dictate the movement. If you need more or less ball speed, hold the ball higher or lower before push-off (higher for faster, lower for slower). 4. Keep your arm completely straight during the entire swing. Tucking your arm too far behind you or too far away from your body creates a bad angle when you release the ball. It's best to keep your arm straight and your elbow and wrist close to your body. There are many different styles, like bending at the waist (à la Walter Ray Williams Jr. or Wes Malott) or opening your shoulders (à la Tommy Jones or Chris Barnes) when you bring your arm up for the backswing, but sticking to the basics is a good idea for a beginner. Remember, try to get the ball to hook when it gets to the dry area at the back of the lane, but until it gets there, the ball is traveling a relatively straight path, varying only a few boards at most. Everyone has a different style, so adjust as you get comfortable. 5. Rotate the ball slightly as it leaves your hand to create spin. As you drop the ball out of the backswing, keep your palm directly underneath the ball, facing upwards. When the ball starts to approach your ankle, rotate the ball so that when you release your hand, it's on the side of the ball and slightly under it. Avoid twisting your wrist as you release; keep your hand under the ball and lift with your fingertips. Then, follow through like you're going to shake hands with the pins. A good way to practice this technique is to throw an underhand spiral with a football; similar physics are involved. You can also practice with a tennis ball. If you get it right, it'll go straight and then bounce drastically to the side. Keep the ball close to your ankle at release. The closer the ball is to your ankle, the more your fingers can be under the ball and provide upward force, thus creating spin. 6. Follow through with your swing after you release the ball. Following through is just as important as the release itself since it helps maintain consistent ball speed and accuracy. Be sure to follow through outward onto the lane, not upward. Your fingers will create the upward lift without you having to lift upward on the ball. An easy way to remember this is the old ESPN advert: \"Roll the ball, then answer the phone.\" Though, hopefully you have better form than the guy in that commercial. And remember, fluidity is essential: don't do the hand-shake, pause slightly, and then do the follow through. Aim for one smooth motion. 7. Make adjustments as you get comfortable with your hook. Once you're comfortable with your release and can execute it properly on a consistent basis, tweak your approach and adjust your footwork in tandem with your release. On a house pattern, remember to move in the direction you're missing. For a right-hander: if your ball hits high (to the left of the headpin), then try moving your feet a couple of boards to the left and keeping your target on the lane the same as before. If you hit the pocket light (to the right of the 3 pin), try moving your feet a couple of boards to the right and keep your target the same. Always move your target on the lane when you move your feet. 8. Invest in a reactive resin bowling ball . No matter what you do, if the bowling ball can't catch any friction on the lanes, it won't be able to hook. It's best to bowl with a ball made of reactive resin or better (e.g. particle-load or newer epoxy resin cover stocks) for anything but the driest of lanes. These balls are easy to find and affordable. Though most bowling centers do offer \"house balls,\" they're usually plastic (polyester) and won't hook very much (though they're good for most spares since they travel very straight). Getting your own plastic ball for spares and a resin ball for strikes (and some spares) is a good idea since house balls don't usually fit your hand perfectly and won't carry pins very well. 9. Get the ball custom fitted for your dominant hand. [6] X Expert Source Chad McLean Bowling Expert Expert Interview When you're getting your ball custom-fitted to your hand, it's important to know how you hold the ball, your point of axis, and how your grip lies. Grip the ball with the two middle fingers (the middle and ring fingers) of your dominant hand and place your thumb the whole way into the thumb hole. There are 2 main types of grips: Conventional : the middle and ring fingers are inserted up to the second knuckle (this is seen in most house balls). [8] X Expert Source Chad McLean Bowling Expert Expert Interview Fingertip grip : the same fingers are inserted only up to the first knuckle (fingertip grips will give you more revs than a conventional grip and are easier to hook). [9] X Expert Source Chad McLean Bowling Expert Expert Interview 10. Get your ball holes drilled properly by a pro when your buy it. This is a personal thing depending on how and where you bowl, so talk to your local pro-shop operator for advice on this one. The drilling for the ball is crucial so the holes are properly fitted to your hand. Once you become a more serious bowler, you may want to learn how to drill your new bowling balls yourself. Talk to your pro-shop guy about your wants; they may be able to recommend things you don't realize you need. Maybe a fingertip grip ? A lower or higher RP differential (lower differential hooks on pearl or matte coverstock, higher on resin)? Or even a different ball or different weight completely!",

    "GPT_text": "Here are the **text steps** (right-handed; lefties mirror them):\n\n1. Setup\n\n* Feet shoulder-width, slide foot slightly ahead.\n* Hold ball at chest height; bowling hand under the ball, non-bowling hand supports.\n* Start with a relaxed, firm wrist and eyes on your target arrow.\n\n2. Grip & Hand Position\n\n* Use a fingertip grip (middle & ring fingers in to the first knuckle; thumb fully in but relaxed).\n* Keep your palm under/behind the ball—don’t cock the wrist outward.\n\n3. 4-Step Approach (righty = R-L-R-L)\n\n* Step 1: Pushaway—ball moves out and down with your first step.\n* Step 2: Ball falls naturally into the backswing.\n* Step 3: Ball reaches the top of the backswing as your third step finishes.\n* Step 4 (slide): Ball returns toward the ankle for release.\n\n4. Swing\n\n* Let the arm swing like a pendulum—no muscling.\n* Keep your swing in one plane next to your body; shoulder stays loose.\n\n5. Release (the hook)\n\n* At the bottom of the swing, next to the ankle, let the **thumb exit first**.\n* As the fingers leave, **lift** and rotate them slightly toward the outside (for right-handers, toward ~3 o’clock) — like a gentle handshake, not a big twist.\n* This gives the ball **counter-clockwise** rotation so it hooks left.\n\n6. Follow-Through\n\n* Hand continues upward to shoulder height, palm toward the target.\n* Finish balanced over the slide foot; hold the pose until the ball hits the pins.\n\n7. Targeting Basics\n\n* Use the lane arrows. A common start is rolling over the **second arrow (10 board)** on the right with a breakpoint near boards **5–8** downlane.\n* If you miss **left** of the pocket, move your feet **left** (and keep the same target). If you miss **right**, move feet **right**.\n\n8. Quick Fixes\n\n* Ball not hooking: relax grip pressure, keep the wrist firm, ensure thumb exits first.\n* Over-turning (big spin, no roll): reduce wrist twist; think “lift” not “twist.”\n* Spraying shots: slow your feet slightly so the swing can sync with the steps.\n\n—\n\nI also created a **visual, step-by-step infographic** showing these moves as panels (stance, grip, approach, swing, release, follow-through, targeting, adjustments). It’s displayed above as a separate image. If you’d like a left-handed version, different colorway, or printable poster size, say the word and I’ll spin it up.\n",

    "prompt": "How to do wall handstand holds? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Find a good spot to do a handstand so that they can help in anyway. You'll need a place with lightly padded ground, since you'll be hitting the floor a few times before you're able to stand correctly on your hands. A park or your yard is an excellent choice, since the grass will give you a nice soft landing and you'll have plenty of open space to work with. This will help to ensure that you don't fall into someone or something, and that you don't hurt yourself. Look for a flat area, rather than a hilly area. It'll be a lot easier to execute the handstand where it's flat. Other great spots to do a handstand are on the sand at the beach, on gym mats at the gym, or in a carpeted room in your home. 2. Stretch your limbs and joints. It's important to warm up a bit before you launch into your handstand. You want your muscles to feel nice and loose, and your body to feel limber. This will decrease the chance that you'll get injured. Do the following stretches to get into gear: Roll your wrists, ankles, and neck until they're nice and loose. Put your feet together and bend down to touch your toes. Try to keep your legs straight. Hold for 30 seconds, stand up, and repeat the stretch with your legs about a foot apart. Take a quick jog around the block to help loosen your muscles. There's no need to run very far; just go until you feel warmed up and ready for a physical challenge. 3. Grab a spotter. The first time you do a handstand, it helps to have someone nearby to help hold you in position until you get the hang of balancing correctly. Ask a friend or family member to stand in front of you at first to catch your legs and hold you straight. Once you can do the handstand without help, ask your spotter not to catch your legs unless you're about to topple over. Having a spotter isn't absolutely necessary. You can perfect your handstand on your own, or try doing it against a wall (see the next method). 4. Stand up straight with your feet comfortably apart. This is your starting position. Your feet, knees, torso and head should all be aligned and completely vertical. Hold your arms comfortably at your side. Some people like to start with their arms straight above their head. You can try both ways and choose the starting position that feels most comfortable to you. 5. Kick with your dominant leg. Then as you kick don't fall into a lunge, both legs should be straight, It shouldn't be very deep but should give you enough power to kick up. Make sure to kick and lunge straight forward, and not to one side or the other. Stepping to the side will cause your body to twist when you go into the handstand, making it much harder to balance. 6. Tip your body forward. Don't fall into a lunge, you will just hurt your back, as you approach the ground, let your legs start to straighten as your hands meet the ground. Hold your arms straight and move your head toward the ground. Move with a bit of force in a natural, forward motion over your lunged leg. This will allow for a balanced system over your lunged leg, where gravity actually aids in the handstand, rather than restricting it. The most common mistake is to throw your hands straight down at the ground and try to throw your legs upward. This results in a whipping motion and causes you to fall forward. 7. Keep your arms straight as your hands approach the ground. Think of your self as a T, Your base leg being the vertical part and your arms and dominant leg being the horizontal part. Keep yourself in this T position until your base leg leaves the ground. Your shoulders should be tight in toward your neck, as though you were shrugging. Don't let your shoulders sag upwards or your elbows bend, which puts you at greater risk for injury. 8. Straighten your legs and torso toward the sky. The act of stepping forward, tipping over, striking the ground with your hands and lifting your legs should be one smooth, fluid motion that ends in a handstand. Keep your head tucked in,as it would be if you were standing up, and your back and legs straight. Don't throw your head back. This will only result in your handstand arching your back and hurting. This won't look as impressive, either. Keep your legs tightly together. Keeping your legs straight and pressed firmly together typically helps you from wanting to fall to the side. 9. Balance your weight on your hands. Keep your weight between your palms and your first knuckles. Adjust your hands to balance your weight by moving it toward your fingers; you're more likely to lose balance if your roll it back toward your wrists. 10. When you are ready to come down, split your legs and drop your dominant leg to the ground. Start to stand up and as you do put your other leg on the ground. Keep your chest up as you stand up and look up. Keep your arms by your ears. 11. End the Handstand with a finish. End your handstand with your arms by your ears . Let your arms fall farther away from your head and turn your palms outwards. 12. Kick up to a handstand. Make sure your weight is over your shoulders so that you can fall backwards. To start of with, bend your arms and tuck into a roll. As you get better at this skill you can try to do it with straight arms, this is the correct way to do it. Teach your body to absorb shock instead of hardening your muscles on impact. Never take too much weight onto one arm or one ankle. Make sure that you tuck your head to your chest before you roll out, as you could fall on your head a little harder than you would like. Another way to fall without hurting yourself is to drop into a \"crab back\", \"arch\", or a \"bridge\", if you are flexible enough.",

Warm up wrists/shoulders first.\n\n## A. Chest-to-Wall (best for alignment)\n\n1. **Setup** — Place hands shoulder-width apart,\n    6–10 in (15–25 cm) from the wall. Fingers spread, middle fingers pointing forward.\n2. **Walk-up** — Start in a plank with feet on the wall. Walk feet up and hands slightly closer until hips stack over shoulders.\n3. **Align** — “Push the floor away,” shrug shoulders tall. Ribs down, glutes tight, legs together, toes on wall. Eyes look between hands (neutral neck).\n4. **Hold** — Maintain a gentle hollow body. Breathe steadily. Aim for **10–30 s**.\n5. **Exit** — Walk hands away from the wall and lower one foot at a time to the floor under control.\n\n## B. Back-to-Wall (easier entry)\n\n1. **Setup** — Stand facing away from the wall, hands on floor about an arm’s length from the wall.\n2. **Kick-up** — Swing one leg up, then the other, letting heels touch the wall lightly.\n3. **Stack & Hold** — Press tall through the hands; keep ribs down and glutes on. Gently tap heels off the wall for micro-balances. Hold **10–30 s**.\n4. **Exit** — Lower one leg softly to the floor.\n\n## C. Progressions\n\n* **Beginner:** L-shape (hips stacked over hands, feet on wall at hip height) for **20–40 s**.\n* **Intermediate:** Chest-to-wall holds **20–40 s**; small **heel pulls** (lift heels 1–2 cm for 1–2 s).\n* **Advanced:** Back-to-wall **balance taps** (briefly hover heels) and freestanding entries.\n\n## D. Sets & Frequency\n\n* **3–5 sets**, rest **60–90 s** between. Practice **3–4×/week**.\n\n## E. Key Cues\n\n* “Hands glue to floor.”\n* “Push tall through shoulders.”\n* “Ribs down, glutes tight.”\n* “Look between hands.”\n\n## F. Common Mistakes (and fixes)\n\n* **Banana back/arching:** Squeeze glutes, tuck ribs.\n* **Hands too close/wide:** Keep shoulder-width, fingers spread.\n* **Head craning:** Keep neck neutral; gaze between hands.\n* **Elbows soft:** Lock out and externally rotate (elbow pits slightly forward).\n\n## G. Safety\n\n* Work within pain-free range. Skip if you have acute wrist, shoulder, or neck issues. Use a spotter if new. Stop if you feel tingling, sharp pain, or dizziness. Finish with wrist/shoulder stretches and child’s pose.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate a second image that focuses just on **alignment cues** or a printable one-page checklist.",

Make sure there's enough room to kick up without hitting anything. 3.  **Position Your Hands:** Place your hands about 6-12 inches away from the wall, shoulder-width apart, with fingers spread wide for stability. Your middle fingers should be pointing straight ahead. 4.  **Kick Up:** From a downward dog position, take a small step in with one foot, then kick up with the other leg, aiming to gently place your heels on the wall. Keep your core tight and arms straight. 5.  **Engage Your Core:** Once in the handstand, actively press your hands into the floor, engage your shoulders, and pull your belly button towards your spine. This will create a solid, straight line from your wrists to your heels. ",

    "prompt": "How to Head a Soccer Ball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Prepare to head the ball. As the soccer ball approaches, you must maintain eye contact with the ball and acquire your balance. Execute these steps at the same time: Keep your eyes open and focused on the ball. Close your mouth. Plant both of your feet firmly on the ground. If you are right handed, your left foot should be slightly forward; if you are left handed, your right foot should be slightly forward. 2. Gain momentum. Once you are braced for the ball's arrival, you need to gain momentum by bending your knees. This will increase your momentum and balance. These movements occur simultaneously: Bend slightly at your knees. Bend backwards at your waist and arch your back. Tuck your chin. 3. Head the ball. Your risk for head injuries increases when you passively allow the ball to hit you. When the ball arrives within heading distance, you need to propel yourself towards the ball in order to actively hit it. This series of movements begins at your hips: As you bend forward at the hips, thrust your head and chin forwards and drive your arms backwards. Hit the ball with the center of your forehead along your hairline. In a game situation, you may need to jump up to reach the ball. 4. Tap the ball with your forehead. This drill teaches players how to move their head towards the ball. It also teaches players how to consistently contact the ball on the correct area of their forehead. Players will also enhance their ability to remain focused on the incoming ball. Have a coach hold the ball four inches from your forehead. When you nod your head, the ball should hit the center of your forehead along your hairline. Keep your mouth shut and your eyes open. While looking at the ball, tap your head against the soccer ball several times. Repeat. Once you have mastered this, take the ball from your coach and hold it above your own forehead. Nod your forehead into the ball as your eyes remain focused on the ball. Do not pull the ball towards your head. 5. Knock the ball off your coach’s hand. This drill reinforces players’ knowledge of how to move their head. It provides them with additional practice of contacting the ball in the correct area of their forehead. This exercise also further develops their ability to remain focused on an incoming ball. Stand up. Have a coach stand 90° to your left or right. The coach stretches out their arm and places a ball on their palm four inches from your forehead. When you nod your head, the ball should hit the center of your forehead along your hairline. Keep your mouth closed and your eyes open. Tap the ball with your forehead, knocking the soccer ball from your coach’s hand. Repeat. 6. Tap the ball from your knees. This drill teaches players how to propel their body towards the ball at their waist. It also allows players to practice tucking their chin. Instead of executing this drill from your knees, you may sit on your heels or on the ground. Place your knees on the ground. Have a coach stand in front of you while holding a ball four inches from your forehead. When your head contacts the ball, it should hit the center of your forehead along your hairline. Simultaneously bend backwards from your waist and tuck your chin. Bend forward from the waist and nod your forehead into the soccer ball. Repeat.. 7. Tap the ball from your feet. After you have mastered tapping the ball from your knees, you can progress to tapping the ball from a standing position. In this drill, players learn how increase their stability through the proper placement of their feet. They also will continue to work on propelling their body forward from their hips. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. If you are right handed, your left foot should be slightly forward; if you are left handed, your right foot should be slightly forward. Have a coach stand in front of you while holding a ball four inches from your forehead. When your head contacts the ball, it should hit the center of your forehead along your hairline. Bend backwards at your waist and tuck your chin. Bend forward at the waist and tap your forehead against the stationary ball. 8. Head a tossed ball. This drill teaches players how to head a ball in motion. As you improve, gradually increase the distance between you and the coach by one-foot increments. The coach may also gradually increase the intensity of the throw, but never the arc. Stand three feet in front of a coach. Place your feet shoulder-width apart. If you are right handed, your left foot should be slightly forward; if you are left handed, your right foot should be slightly forward. The coach gently underhand tosses the ball in a slight arch towards your forehead. As the ball approaches you, bend backwards at the waist and tuck your chin. Just before the ball reaches your forehead, bend forward at the waist and contact the ball. Try to head the ball back at the coach’s waist. Repeat. 9. Execute a defensive header. Defensive players commonly use headers to clear the ball away from the goal. The objects of the defensive header are to move the ball away from the center of the field and as far down the field as possible. To execute this header, position your body towards the outside of the field and hit the bottom of the ball as hard as you can with the center of your forehead near your hairline. 10. Execute a flick header. Players use the flick header to pass the ball from teammate to teammate. Both offensive and defensive players use this form of header. To execute the flick header, hit the ball on the top of your head as you simultaneously move your head up and backwards. 11. Head the ball into the goal. There are three types of headers you can use to score on goal. These include an offensive header, diving header, and glancing header. Offensive headers used to place the ball low in the goal; diving headers are executed when the ball is too far out in front of your foot to kick with any appreciable force; glancing headers are used to fake out the goalie. Offensive headers: Effective offensive headers are kept low and directed towards the ground. Head the ball down and away from the goalie. Diving headers: When you dive towards the ball, the momentum of your entire body propels the ball towards its target. As you dive at the ball, focus on contacting the ball with your forehead and directing the ball towards the goal. Try to land the dive on your chest and arms. Do not break the fall with your wrists. Glancing header: This cross-body header is used to fake out goalies. In order to execute this header effectively, you must learn how to direct the ball with your forehead. If you want to head the ball to the left, try to hit the right side of the ball; if you want to head the ball to the right, try to hit the left side of the ball. Do not use the side of your head to hit the ball.",

    "prompt": "How to Hold a Cricket Bat? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Lay the bat on the ground. A cricket bat has a flat side for striking the ball, and the back has a ridge, or spine, running down the middle. The spine should be facing up. 2. Make a 'V' shape defined by the thumb and forefinger of both hands. Hold your hands in front of you, palms down. Your fingers on both hands should be grouped together, but for your thumbs, which extend to the sides to form the 'V' shape. The 'V's should be upside down – i.e. open end towards the ground. Maintain this 'V' shape as you reach for the bat. 3. Line up your grip with the spine of the bat. As you grip the handle, keep your two 'V's facing downward (towards the bat handle), so that the inflection point of the 'V's (where the base of your thumb and forefinger meet) on both hands is in line with the spine along the backside of the bat blade. If you tilt your hands slightly so that the 'V's formed by your thumbs and forefingers are aligned with the part of the bat that lies between the spine and edge of the bat, this will give you more power when cutting or pulling the ball, and by changing the angle of the bat face, help to keep the ball on the ground. Both the cut and pull are cross-bat shots utilizing a horizontal swing to hit the ball on a trajectory perpendicular to the direction of the bowl. The cut shot uses a shorter swing to hit the ball in the direction the batter is facing (the off side). The pull uses a longer swing to hit the ball to the part of the field behind him as he faces the batter (the leg side). 4. Make sure your hands are in the middle of the handle. Your dominant (top) hand should be closer to the top of the handle, and your other (bottom) hand should be closer to the bat blade. Putting your hands in the middle of handle gives the best combination of power and control. A high grip (hands towards the end of the handle) will generate more power. This is good for playing vertical shots (when the bat is swung upward at the ball on a vertical plane) that drive the ball. A low grip, or “choking” the bat (hands towards the blade of the bat) will give you more control. This is good for horizontal or cross-bat shots (when the bat is swung horizontally, as in baseball). 5. Keep a distance of about two fingers between your hands. The closer you place your hands, the more power and less control you have. Moving them further apart will give you more control at the expense of power. 6. Keep your top hand firm and your bottom hand relaxed. Imagine you were holding a baby chick with your bottom hand; that is the amount of pressure to apply. You want your grip to be loose so that during your backswing, the bottom three fingers can come away from the bat, which is guided by only the thumb and forefinger of your bottom hand. This allows for a fuller swing. 7. Hit a variety of shots with the orthodox grip. This grip allows you to hit cross-batted shots, while also keeping the face of the bat square to the ball when hitting vertical shots, thus minimizing the danger of edging the ball. Edging is when the ball is struck with the edge of the bat instead of the face. These glancing shots are often caught for an out by the wicket keeper or the slips – fielders who are positioned behind the batter. 8. Start with the orthodox grip, then rotate your bottom hand so your fingers are fully under the bat when the flat side is facing downward. In the orthodox grip, only the tips of your fingers will rest under the bat handle when the flat side faces downward. With the 'O' shaped grip, your entire fingers will rest under the bat. This means you will rotate the 'V' formed by the thumb and forefinger of your bottom hand – counterclockwise if your right hand is the bottom one, clockwise if your left – so that the 'V' faces the edge of the bat. If you are holding the flat side of the bat downwards, this means the 'V' formed by your bottom hand will now be oriented horizontally to the ground, rather than facing downwards. 9. Use the 'O' shaped grip for more power on cross-batted shots. This grip feels more natural than the orthodox grip, but because it gives the bottom hand more influence, it leads to swinging across the line (laterally to the ball), which makes it harder to hit vertical shots. 10. Know that batters often adopt this technique when using bats that are too heavy for them. If you find yourself having a hard time making solid contact on vertical swings, or often edging the ball behind to the keeper or slips, then you may need to try a lighter bat, which allows you to use a more orthodox grip. 11. Start with the orthodox grip, then rotate your top hand around the handle. Rotate clockwise if your top hand is your left hand, or counterclockwise if it is your right. Keep rotating until the back of your top hand is almost facing the same direction as the back of your bottom hand. If holding the flat side of the bat towards the ground, the 'V' formed by the thumb and forefinger of your top hand should now right side up – i.e. the 'V' should open upwards. 12. Use the Knott grip to better hit fast, short bowling. This grip was developed by Alan Knott to deal with fast bowling and high rising balls. It allows for an extremely fast, short swing, perfect for cutting the ball. Fast bowling – Fast bowlers specialize in bowling the ball fast, as opposed to generating spin. Bowling over 87mph (140kmph) is generally considered fast bowling. The fastest bowlers can throw the ball over 96 mph (154 km/h) (155kmph). Short bowling – In cricket, the ball is usually bounced before it reaches the batter. Fast bowlers often bounce the ball well short of the batter, so that it rises to chest or head height as it reaches them. A quick bat helps the batsman to hit shots at waist to shoulder height. 13. Be aware that the Knott grip makes it difficult to generate power. Because this grip limits the extension of your arms, it also limits the ability to create power. It is best for working singles or twos (the two batsmen run to each other's end of the pitch one or two times) as opposed to hitting boundaries (the ball is hit out of the field of play).",

    "GPT_text": "# How to Hold a Cricket Bat (Orthodox Grip)\n\n*Right-handed batter shown; left-handers swap hands.*\n\n## Step-by-step\n\n1. **Set up.** Stand side-on to the bowler with your feet shoulder-width apart. Rest the bat **upright** beside your back foot with the **bat face** pointing straight ahead.\n2. **Top (control) hand on.** Place your **top hand** high on the handle (for right-handers this is the **left** hand). Let the handle sit in your **fingers more than the palm** for flexibility. The **“V”** formed by your thumb and index finger should point **between the splice and the outside edge** on the **back** of the bat.\n3. **Shape the top hand.** Wrap your fingers comfortably. Keep the wrist relaxed and slightly cocked so the bat can move freely. Pressure here should be your anchor: about **6/10**.\n4. **Bottom (power/guide) hand on.** Slide your **bottom hand** (right hand for right-handers) just **below** the top hand—**touching or with a tiny 0–1 finger gap**. Form the same **“V”** with thumb and index and align it **on the same line** as the top hand’s V (toward the outside edge on the back of the bat).\n5. **Balance the pressure.** Keep the **top hand firm, bottom hand light** (about **3/10**). If both hands squeeze hard, your wrists lock and the bat face closes.\n6. **Check the bat face.** With the bat resting, lift it an inch and look down: the **blade should stay neutral/straight**, not twisting closed (toward leg side) or open (toward off side). Re-set the bottom hand if it turns the face.\n7. **Pick-up rehearsal.** Make a small back-and-through swing. The bat should travel comfortably in a straight path; if it wobbles or the face turns, ease the bottom-hand grip or realign the Vs.\n8. **Left-handers.** Reverse the hands: right hand is the **top** (control) hand, left is the **bottom** hand. All other cues stay the same.\n\n## Quick self-checks\n\n* **V-lines match:** Both Vs point **between the splice and outside edge** on the **back** of the bat.\n* **Hands together:** No more than a fingertip gap; no big separation.\n* **Fingers, not palms:** You can flex the wrists easily.\n* **Top hand leads:** You can guide the bat one-handed with the top hand without losing control.\n\n## Common mistakes (and quick fixes)\n\n* **Bottom-hand dominance:** Face turns closed → Loosen the bottom hand and realign its V.\n* **Hands too far apart:** Reduces control → Bring hands together.\n* **Death-grip:** White knuckles, stiff wrists → Breathe out, relax grip to 6/10 (top) and 3/10 (bottom).\n* **Handle buried in palms:** Limits range → Let the handle sit across your fingers.\n\n## Optional variations\n\n* **Power-hitting tweak (T20):** Rotate the **bottom hand** a touch **under** the handle (slightly stronger position) for extra forearm leverage—keep the top hand in control so the bat still swings straight.\n",

Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n**Step 1: The 'V' Shape with Your Top Hand**\nHold the bat in front of you with the splice facing up. Place your top hand (the hand closer to the handle's top) around the handle. Your thumb and forefinger should form a 'V' shape pointing down the bat towards the blade. This grip allows for control and guidance of the bat.\n\n\n**Step 2: Bottom Hand Placement**\nNow, place your bottom hand (the hand closer to the bat's blade) on the handle about an inch or two below your top hand. The 'V' formed by your thumb and forefinger of the bottom hand should also point down the bat, similar to your top hand. This hand provides power and stability.\n\n\n**Step 3: Finding Your Comfortable Grip**\nThe exact position of your hands can vary slightly based on personal preference and batting style. Some players prefer a slightly looser bottom hand for more wristy shots, while others might grip tighter for more power. Experiment to find a grip that feels comfortable and allows you to control the bat effectively. The key is to have a firm but not overly tense grip.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Drive a Golf Ball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Choose a driver with the proper loft. Since the science of the sport and the equipment have progressed, opt for a driver with 9 or 10 degrees of loft rather than an older 7 or 8 degree driver. Amateur players can optimize the carry of the ball by selecting a driver with 1-3 more degrees of loft than tour-pros. A higher lofted driver will give you more carry which can help you stay more consistent in your shots. The launch-angle (determined by the loft on the club-head striking the ball), the speed that the ball comes off the club-face (determined by club-head speed as it strikes the golf-ball), and the spin of the golf-ball (determined by the prior 2 factors as well as some other factors including the grooves on the club-face, whether any grass got in between the club-face and the ball at impact, etc.) allow the ball to remain in the air (carry). 2. Pick the right club. [1] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview While you mostly use a driver off the tee for a par 4 or par 5, you have options of another wood or iron. You won’t always use a driver when driving a golf ball. Some holes will be set up so that you have to use a 3, 5, or even 7 wood, or one of your irons, say if you are on a par 3. Account for the design of hole you are playing as well as your own game when choosing a club. For instance, if you hit your 3-wood farther than your driver and think you could use an 8-iron to the green after hitting the ball with the 3-wood, you may want to select the 3-wood to take your first shot if you do well with the 8-iron. You can use your swing speed to help determine which club you need off a tee shot. Say you hit your 7 iron 150 yards, your swing speed is most likely around 95-104 mph. An 8 or 9 iron will be around 105-115 mph. Irons have a higher loft than woods and in the case of a par 3 hole, you’ll be aiming directly for the green, which means you want more carry and less roll. If the green is less than 200 yards (183 m) away, you’re going to want to use an iron. 3. Know what kind of ball you’re using. Picking the right golf ball for your game can be a bit of a headache. You have to factor spin, hardness, distance, and most importantly, feel. Unfortunately, there’s no “golden ball” that has all the answers for you. The best way to determine the right ball for you is to go to your local golf shop and talk to a professional about what you want in your shot. They can work with you to determine your club-head speed and help you choose golf balls with the correct thickness of the cover and density of the core for your golfing style. Hit a few balls and rely on how they feel. Golf is one the most mental games out there and feeling comfortable in what you’re hitting can greatly affect your shot. Note that professional rules prohibit you from using different types of balls during the same round. However, if you are playing with friends, bring several types of balls and experiment to find which works the best for you. 4. Pick the right tee. Nowadays everything in golf has multiple options to choose from, including the tee you use. With a lot of modern drivers having large heads, the need to make taller tees arose, resulting in tees of varying lengths. When you take a shot, the golf ball should be teed up high enough that the top of the driver club-face dissects the ‘equator’ of the golf ball. To avoid hitting the ground before hitting a teed up golf ball, use a taller tee. Similarly, if you’re on a long par 4 or par 5 and need to crush the ball to hit the green within par, a taller tee for your driver is usually the way to go. However, a taller tee isn’t always the best option when using an iron as you could tee the ball too high and cut under the ball. When using an iron, tee up the ball so it appears to be resting on top of the grass. Only the bottom 1 ⁄ 4 to 1 ⁄ 10 inch (0.64 to 0.25 cm) of the ball needs to be above the ground. 5. Align your body with a vertical marker in the distance. Pick a vertical marker like a tree or a standing person directly past the horizontal point where you want the ball the land. It’s better to use a vertical marker than a horizontal one. Once you find your marker, align your body to set up to that target. You can draw an invisible line from the marker to a spot a few yards in front of the golf ball to help you align yourself. If you have a tendency to bend your left arm early, that will hinder distance; keep your \"V\" as long as possible before it bends at the finish of your swing and you will find yourself getting much more distance. For a lot of golfers, it’s easy to pick some sort of marker that’s inline with where you want the place the ball on the fairway. You’ll know roughly how far you're going to hit the ball , so pick a spot and then look for a tree or something past your target to aim for, as an object is easier to aim for than a spot on the ground. 6. Set your feet in the proper position. Because a golf swing has both a horizontal and vertical feature, the center of your swing will be a couple inches on the target side of your sternum. [2] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview Position the ball inline with the heel of your front foot, or where the pocket or logo is on your shirt (if you’re a righty). Avoid positioning the ball toward the front of your stance, as this can make it more difficult to make good contact and hit the ball before the ground. Positioning the ball toward the front of your stance can also exacerbate problems with slicing or fading. Position your feet about 1.5 ft (0.46 m) apart if you’re using an iron or 2 ft (0.61 m) apart for a driver. 7. Adjust your arms. You want your arms to be straight and form a “V” shape when you set up your stance. For a drive, think of your body as making a reverse “K”. Grip the club so the front edge of it is flat on the ground. Put your hands 2.5-3 hand widths in front of the inside of your front thigh. With your arms in place for your swing you should stand about 8 inches (20 cm) from the butt of your grip at address. 8. Use the proper grip pressure. [4] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview Even though you may think that gripping harder and swinging harder produces better results, that is isn’t the case. A grip that’s too hard can hinder your ability to achieve consistent distance. Instructing legend, Phil Galvano first introduced the idea that you will find that the great players indicated that the grip pressure should resemble holding a bird without crushing it, but also not letting it go. The tighter you hold the club , the less it will release throughout the ball. Your hands should be free of tension. Try different grip strengths at the range and watch for the results. Notice when your club doesn’t connect well because you grip too loose, or you skull the ball because you’re gripping too tightly. If you’re a righty, you want to grip the club with your left hand where your fingers meet the palm of your hand. If you’re a lefty, do the same with your right hand. Curl your fingers around the club and then without moving the grip, roll your hand over so your thumb is on the on the top of the grip. Do the same with your other hand (right hand if you’re a righty, and left if you’re a lefty). Position the club between your fingers and palm, and place your pinky on the knuckle between your index and middle fingers. You can also interlock them if you prefer. Roll your thumb over the thumb on your other hand. 9. Know what kind of swing you’re using. You should have two swings, one for power and one for control. Not every hole is going to allow you to crush the ball as far as you can. Some holes may have a water hazard cutting through it or dogleg to the right or left, so you have to be able to control the distance of your shot as well. For a power swing, you want to position your head and the shaft slightly back behind your ball with a slightly wider stance. For a control shot, narrow your stance slightly, position the ball slightly further back in your stance, and choke down on the club a bit. 10. Start your backswing. [6] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview Your driver swing can be the difference between birdie and bogey. When you go for your backswing, you should shift your weight backward. This will give your swing more power. A lot of times your instinct might be to have a fast backswing thinking that it will give you more power to crush the ball. This is a trap as swinging too fast will take you out of alignment. Stay flat. Your driving wood should stay along the ground, or just kissing the grass-you don’t want to drive it into the ground-for at least the first 20 to 25 percent of your swing. If your club is lifting up, you will pop the ball up and not get that long, smooth drive that you see the pros hit regularly. Take a steady backswing and pause at the top to reset before begin your downswing. This doesn’t mean stopping as that will throw off your momentum. Think of it as hovering slightly before going down. 11. Keep the start of your downswing calm and unhurried. [8] X Expert Source Michael Metz Golf Instructor Expert Interview This enables you to build up speed so that the golf club is still accelerating when it reaches the ball. Your downswing should be one single movement that utilizes your entire body at the same time. But don’t rush here as you’ll go off plane if you do. One very important factor on your downswing is to keep your head down and in place. This all happens very quickly and you may be excited to see how far you’ve hit the ball. But moving your head will move your whole body and ruin your shot. You may be tempted to try and help the ball up by raising your arms. But keep your swing consistent and trust that your club will do the work. 12. Keep the angle on your leading hand. Many amateurs tend to flip the hands forward in an effort to get the ball in the air, which defeats the purpose of having good equipment and a proper setup. The leading hand (left hand for most players, right hand for lefties) should be angled down towards the ball on the downswing. Think of it like hitting the ball with the back of leading hand. If your hand is flipping down on the downswing, you may hit the ground before the ball or only hit the top of the ball. Keeping the angle starts the ball low and lets it climb on its own through your generated power. 13. Finish the golf swing by following through. The club should swing over your left shoulder (for right-handed golfers) or your right shoulder (for left-handed golfers). Again, don't be in a rush to look up and see where the ball went. If you did this correctly, the ball will travel where you want it to.",

    "prompt": "How to Serve in Table Tennis? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Hold the ball flat in the palm of your hand. To start a legal serve, keep your hand completely open and flat after you pick up the ball. Let the ball sit there for a second or two, as your hand needs to be stationary, or still, before you throw it up into the air. Any illegal serve can result in the official calling it “incorrect.” While you may be warned one time during a match or if the official is unsure if the serve is legal, any clearly incorrect serves will lead your opponent to get your points! 2. Keep the ball above the table and behind your serve line. The hand holding the ball (which will become your “free hand”) has to be above the table as you get ready to serve. The ball itself should remain behind the end of the table (your serve line). Your thumb can cross the serve line as long as the ball itself doesn’t. 3. Keep your racket hand below the table to hide it. Unlike the ball, your racket can be hidden under the table. Doing this may help you hide the kind of serve you’re going to make. You’ll need to quickly bring your racket up once you throw the ball into the air to get ready to serve. Until you’ve practiced serving, leave your racket hand above the table. This tricky technique is legal, but it’s best reserved for more advanced players. 4. Throw the ball at least 6.3 inches (16 cm) up in the air. This is the minimum height required by the officials. Any lower and it won’t be counted as a legal serve. The ball needs to be thrown up vertically rather than sideways or diagonally. Make sure that your throw makes the ball go almost straight up into the air. You can’t, for example, just drop the ball from a height of 6.3 inches (16 cm). This won’t be considered a vertical toss. 5. Strike the ball when it’s falling. Don’t hit the ball when it’s still going up in the air or when it’s at the top of your throw. Wait until it’s coming back down toward the table to avoid getting called out by the official. 6. Bounce the ball on your side before it goes over the net. Hit the ball so that it lands on your side first. If it just sails over the net without bouncing, it’s an illegal serve. Practice until you get the proper amount of force needed to follow this rule. You want a serve that’s fast enough to trick your opponent, but not so strong that it misses your side of the table. The ball can also go around the net so long as you can curve it enough to get it back onto your opponent’s side of the table. This is a pretty difficult skill, so aim straight over the net until you’re sure you can make a curving serve. 7. Hit anywhere on the table if you’re playing singles. Your opponent’s whole side is fair game if it’s just the two of you. This lets you really use the table. You can do short and long serves to make the match more difficult for your opponent. 8. Hit the opposite diagonal if you’re playing doubles. You’re restricted to the square that’s diagonal from you if you’re playing with partners. Anything that hits outside this square is illegal. 9. Move your free arm away from the ball once you’ve served. It’s illegal to “hide” the ball from the official or your opponent with your hand once you’ve served. Pull your free hand all the way back so you don’t get accused of doing this.",

Racket relaxed near your hip; eyes on the ball.\n3. **Plan:** Decide spin (backspin, sidespin/topspin, or no-spin), placement (short, long, wide), and follow-up shot.\n4. **Toss:** Throw the ball **near-vertically at least 16 cm (≈6 in)** and **without imparting spin**. Keep your free arm and body from hiding the ball—**the receiver must see it at all times**.\n5. **Contact (as it falls):** Strike the ball **after it starts descending**. Brush to create spin:\n\n   * **Backspin/short:** Fine under-brush; contact low; short follow-through.\n   * **Sidespin/topspin:** Brush the side/top (pendulum or reverse-pendulum motion).\n     **Contact must be behind your end line**.\n6. **Bounce sequence:** The ball must **first bounce on your side**, clear the net, and then **land on the opponent’s side** (once or more).\n7. **Follow-through & Recover:** Keep the motion compact, return to ready position immediately for the third ball.\n\n# Quick legality checklist\n\n* Open palm, ball at rest to start.\n* Toss ≥16 cm, near-vertical, **no spin on the toss**.\n* Ball **always above the table** and **behind your end line** until struck.\n* **Not hidden** by body or arm.\n* Strike **as it falls**; first bounce on your side.\n\n# Useful serve variations\n\n* **Pendulum:** Forehand side-swing; heavy sidespin/backspin, usually into receiver’s backhand.\n* **Reverse Pendulum:** Opposite sidespin; great to the forehand or elbow.\n* **Tomahawk:** Side/topspin with a forehand chopping-up motion.\n* **Backhand:** Quick, compact; easy to place short to the middle.\n* **Fast Long No-spin:** Flat hit to the elbow or wide corner to surprise.\n\n# Common faults to avoid\n\n* Tossing too low or on a curve.\n* Contacting the ball **while it’s rising**.\n* Letting the free arm/body **hide** the ball.\n* Starting with ball **below table** or **over the table** (must be behind end line).\n* Forgetting that in **doubles** the serve **must land diagonally** (server’s right to receiver’s right).\n\n# Practice mini-drills\n\n* **Toss drill:** 50 legal tosses in a row to ~20 cm.\n* **Spin quality:** Serve 5 minutes trying to make the second bounce come back toward the net (backspin) or kick wide (sidespin).\n* **Placement cones:** Aim for two coin-sized targets—one short, one deep—to build control.\n\nIf you want, I can generate separate images for each step or for specific serve variations (pendulum, reverse, tomahawk, backhand).\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Stand with your shoulders square to the court. Stand behind the baseline (the line parallel to the net at the end of the tennis court). Stand sideways to the court with your shoulders lined up parallel to the baseline. This stance is used in nearly all tennis serves, but is especially important for a kick serve. Having your body square to the court allows you to impart as much spin to the ball as possible. 2. Keep your feet 2 feet (0.61 m) apart and behind the baseline. Situate your rear foot so that it’s parallel to the baseline and about 2.5 feet (0.76 m) behind the line. Then, position your front foot at a 45-degree angle with your toes pointing in towards the court. Make sure that your feet stay behind the baseline throughout the kick serve. If you step over the baseline, the serve may be disqualified. 3. Hold the racket with a Western grip to achieve maximum topspin. To use a Western grip, hold the tennis racket in your dominant hand so the head is perpendicular to the ground. Place the lowest knuckle of your thumb against the top-left beveled edge of the shaft. Wrap your hand around the shaft so that your index finger just touches the tip of your thumb. Using a Western grip when hitting a kick serve allows for maximum spin and power. The Western grip is also often referred to as a continental grip. In non-technical terms, topspin means that the ball is spinning forward in the same direction that it's traveling. This will make the ball bounce high when it lands. 4. Toss the ball in the air above you and tilt your heat back to watch. Use your non-dominant hand to throw the tennis ball about 4–6 feet (1.2–1.8 m) into the air, so it reaches its peak slightly behind your head. Tilt your head back and keep your eyes on the ball. It’s important to watch the ball as it rises, or you will miss when you swing for it. This placement of the ball in the air will allow you to reach back and hit upwards on the ball, thereby creating maximum topspin. If the ball is in front of you when you throw it, you won’t be able to give it much spin. 5. Bend your elbow and cock the racket back behind your head. Hold your racket low with your dominant hand while you’re tossing the ball in the air. As soon as you release the ball, bend your dominant elbow so that your fist comes close to your shoulder and rotate your dominant shoulder back. This wind-up will raise the racket and prepare you to hit the ball. When you’re fully wound up, the middle of the racket’s head should be at eye level. Winding up your arm like this will give you a great deal of serving power. A solid wind-up will also position your racket to imparts maximum spin to the ball. 6. Arch your back and bend your knees to keep the ball in sight. As you reach the peak of your wind-up, bend your knees and lower your torso by 6–8 inches (15–20 cm). Push out your chest and arch your back so you can reach back behind you when you swing at the ball. Bending your knees will also allow you to lean your torso back so you can keep your eyes on the ball. 7. Extend your arm quickly and strike the ball at the peak of its arc. When you move to strike the ball, extend your arm and swing the racket up behind your head towards the ball. Extend your legs too, so that you jump about 2 inches (5.1 cm) high in the air. When your racket is at the same height as the ball, whip your wrist forward so that the head of the racket connects with the ball. It’s important that you do all of this while the tennis ball is at the peak of its arc. If you hit once the ball is coming back down, you won’t be able to put much spin on it. 8. Push up and forward on the ball to give it an aggressive topspin. Swing your racket as if you’re going to hit through the ball. As soon as you feel the racket connect with the ball, straighten your elbow and \"roll\" your racket forward over the ball. Finish the serve with the racket at the level of hip opposite your serving hand. If you finish your serve and the hand holding the racket is still on the side of your body with your dominant arm, you haven’t hit through the ball and your serve won’t have any real power. Imagine that the ball has numbers on it, like those on the face of a clock. Strike the ball with your racket at the 7 o’clock position. Push your racket forwards and up over the ball until it’s at the 2 o’clock position. Done properly, this will create topspin on the ball. 9. Aim at least 8 ft (2.4 m) deep in your opponent’s service box. Topspin causes the ball to go shorter in the court than a flat serve or a slice serve, so you will have to compensate by aiming deeper into the court. Keep your aim focused on the service box so that the ball doesn’t hit the net or land too far back in your opponent’s side of the court. The result will be that the ball lands perfectly: it will hit deep in the service box, then kick high. If you’re not familiar with tennis jargon, the service box is part of the tennis court on your opponent’s side. It’s in front of the service line (the line that horizontally bisects each half of the tennis court) and on the left side of the center service line (the line that vertically bisects the half of the tennis court in front of the service line). All initial serves must land in your opponent’s service box. 10. Follow through by bringing the racket toward your opposite foot. Following through will ensure that you’ve given the ball as much spin and power as possible. If you’re right handed, follow through by bringing the racket down so it’s nearly touching the toes of your left foot. The follow-through is reversed if you’re serving left-handed: once you’ve hit the ball, bring the racket down so it almost taps the toes of your right foot. Stay close to the baseline as you follow through. Don’t finish with your body too far into the court or you may trip over your own feet. 11. Practice serving or in pairs until you master the topspin serve. Practice will lead to perfecting your kick serve. Get a bucket of balls and practice your kick serve 20, 50, or 100 times in a row. Then, ask a more experienced tennis player to watch you and give you some pointers. Try going out to the courts with a friend and practicing. Having a receiver who gives constructive feedback will help you quick establish a powerful kick serve. You will find the kick serve to be a wonderful asset as you improve your tennis game. It’s a great way to keep opponents on their toes. 12. Use a kick serve as your second serve in a singles or doubles match . Tennis players use kick serves as an efficient and accurate second serve. They do this because a kick serve forces your opponent to return a ball that has tremendous spin and bounces higher than the normal flat or slice serve . As a second serve, the kick serve is more likely to surprise your opponent and keep you from losing a point. In tennis, if the first serve goes out of bounds, you’re given a second opportunity to serve without penalty. If you miss the second serve, you lose a point from your score. Once you are able to consistently lob the kick serve deep into your opponent’s service box, nail the spin so that it pops up to shoulder height, you will have mastered the kick serve.",

    "text_ref": "1. Master the Continental Grip. To place your hand for the continental grip, hold your racket pointing away from you with your left hand. Orient the string area so that it is perpendicular to the ground. Put your right hand out as if to shake hands with the grip of the racket, and place the base knuckle of your index finger on the small, sloped side of the grip to the right of the flat side on top. Close your hand around the grip so that this same bevel of the grip goes diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie. The Continental Grip is: the most basic forehand grip in tennis. standard for serves and preferred for volleys. difficult to use for working with topspin or backspin. 2. Use the Eastern Forehand Grip. To place your hand for the Eastern forehand grip, start by holding your racket pointing away from you with your left hand. Orient the string area so that it is perpendicular to the ground. Put your right hand out as if to shake hands with the grip of the racket, and place the base knuckle of your index finger on the long flat side of the grip facing straight out to your right. Close your hand around the grip so that this same bevel of the grip goes diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie. The Eastern Forehand Grip is: a classic, versatile grip good for squarely-placed swings or slices. basic, but still used by pros. not optimal for topspin either coming or going. 3. Try the Semi-Western Grip. To find the Semi-Western grip, hold your racket pointing away from you with your left hand. Orient the string area so that it is perpendicular to the ground. Put your right hand out as if to shake hands with the grip of the racket, and place the base knuckle of your index finger on the small, slanted plane of the grip facing downward and to your right. Close your hand around the grip so that this same bevel of the grip goes diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie. The Semi-Western Grip is: a grip that tilts your racket downward, forcing an upward swing and promoting topspin. the game-changing grip preferred by many pros. not a good grip for slicing or hitting low balls. 4. Find the Western Grip. Start by holding your racket pointing away from you with your left hand. Orient the string area so that it is perpendicular to the ground. Put your right hand out as if to shake hands with the grip of the racket, and place the base knuckle of your index finger on the flat plane of the grip located on the very underside of the grip. Close your hand around the grip so that this same bevel of the grip goes diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie. The Western Grip is: an extreme topspin creator. very bad for low balls, slicing, or square hits. 5. Use the Eastern Backhand Grip. To achieve the Eastern Backhand Grip, use your left hand to hold your racket in front of you. Point the grip to the right and orient the string area perpendicular to the ground, facing you. Hold your right hand straight out directly above the grip. Bring it directly down so your base index knuckle rests completely on the top facet of the grip, and close your hand around it squarely. The Eastern Backhand Grip is: the most common backhand grip. a versatile, stable grip that can generate a little topspin or hit more directly. good for hitting low balls, not good for controlling high ones. 6. Try the Extreme Eastern or Semi-Western Backhand Grip. To position your hand for the extreme eastern or semi-western grip, hold your racket pointing away from you with your left hand. Orient the string area so that it is perpendicular to the ground. Put your right hand out as if to shake hands with the grip of the racket, and place the base knuckle of your index finger on the small, slanted facet of the grip just to the left of the flat top. Close your hand around the grip so that this same bevel of the grip goes diagonally across your palm to point toward the heel of your palm below your pinkie. This grip is: only used by stronger, more advanced players. good for controlling high balls and generating topspin. difficult for transitioning closer to the net and bad for hitting low balls. 7. Master the Two-Handed Backhand Grip. The most common way to perform a two-handed backhand is by placing your dominant hand in the Continental Grip (base index knuckle on the top right slanted facet), and then placing your other hand just above it in the Semi-Western Forehand Grip (base index knuckle on the bottom left slanted facet). This grip: is much more powerful than a one-handed backhand. makes it difficult to slice, volley, and reach out for wider shots.",

For right-handers, count bevels clockwise from the top flat face (left-handers mirror the numbers).\n\n2. **Choose a baseline: Continental (“handshake”)**\n   Place the **base knuckle of your index finger** and your **heel pad** on **bevel #2** (left-handers: bevel #8). This all-purpose grip works for serves, volleys, slices, and defense.\n\n3. **Set the handshake**\n   Slide your hand down from the throat as if shaking hands with the handle. Wrap your middle–ring–pinky; let the index finger sit slightly forward like a trigger for control.\n\n4. **Place the thumb**\n   Lay the thumb diagonally across the back of the handle (not straight down the flat). Keep it relaxed so the wrist can move.\n\n5. **Check the “V”**\n   The V between your thumb and index should point roughly toward your hitting-side shoulder. At rest, the racket face should be close to vertical.\n\n6. **Squeeze & test**\n   Hold firm but not tight—about a 4–5/10 squeeze. Bounce a few balls and shadow-swing. Adjust later if needed: **Eastern FH = bevel #3**, **Semi-Western FH = #4** (left-handers mirror).\n\n*The image guide is shown separately above.*\n",

    "Gemini_text": "Learning how to grip a tennis racket is fundamental to developing your game. There are several grips, but let's focus on a basic, versatile grip often recommended for beginners, like the Eastern Forehand Grip.\n\nHere are 6 steps to achieve this grip:\n\n1.  **Understand the Bevels:** Look at the octagonal handle of your racket. Imagine it has 8 sides, or \"bevels.\" Hold the racket face perpendicular to the ground, as if you're about to shake hands with it. The top flat surface is bevel #1. Going clockwise for a right-handed player (counter-clockwise for a left-handed player), the next bevel is #2, and so on.\n\n2.  **Find Your Index Knuckle Base:** Place the palm of your non-hitting hand flat against the strings of your racket.\n\n3.  **Place the Racket in Your Hand:** Now, bring your dominant hand to the racket handle. The base knuckle of your index finger (the one closest to your palm) is your key reference point.\n\n4.  **Position for the Eastern Forehand:** For an Eastern Forehand grip, place the base knuckle of your index finger directly on bevel #3. This is the third bevel clockwise from the top if you're right-handed.\n\n5.  **Wrap Your Fingers:** Wrap your fingers naturally around the handle. Your thumb should rest somewhat diagonally across your palm, or gently wrap around the handle. Avoid gripping too tightly at this stage.\n\n6.  **Check Your Grip:** Hold the racket out in front of you. You should be able to slide a finger or two between your palm and the handle. This ensures you're not gripping too far down the handle, which can restrict wrist movement. The \"V\" shape formed by your thumb and index finger should be generally aligned with the edge of the racket frame.\n\nHere is an image to illustrate the grip:\n`",

    "prompt": "How to Use a Foam Roller on Your Back? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Perform calf rolls. Start by sitting on an exercise mat with your legs extended straight in front of you. Place the roller beneath your calves about halfway between your knees and ankles. Cross your right ankle over the left, place your palms flat on the floor just behind you, and lift your bottom off of the floor. Use your hands and arms to slowly shift your body so your left calf muscle slides over the roller. Remember to engage your core muscles to keep your back straight. Roll over the muscle for 30 to 60 seconds, then repeat the steps on the other leg. Crossing your ankles increases the pressure on the targeted muscles, which makes the roller more effective. However, if it feels uncomfortable or if you have trouble keeping your balance, try keeping your legs uncrossed. 2. Loosen up your hamstrings, or the backs of your thighs. Start by sitting on the floor with your knees slightly bent. Position the foam roller under your thighs about halfway between your knees and hips. Place your palms flat on the floor, then lift your bottom so the foam roller supports all of your lower body weight. Use your hands and arms to slide your body so the roller glides down the length of your hamstrings. Try to keep your hamstrings relaxed as you slowly slide backward and forward for 30 to 60 seconds. To increase pressure, try crossing one leg over the other and roll your hamstrings individually. If you need to lower the pressure, put more of your body weight onto your hands or touch the foot of your leg that’s not on the roller to the floor. 3. Move on to your glutes. Sit on the roller where your hamstrings meet your glutes, just below the hip bones. With your palms flat on the floor just behind you, use your hands and arms to slide your glutes over the roller. Sit on the roller to target piriformis syndrome. Bend the knee up on the side you are targeting. To increase pressure, cross your right leg over your left so your right shin rests on your left thigh. Roll for 30 to 60 seconds, then switch sides and repeat. Use the roller only on the fleshy, muscular areas of your bottom. Don’t slide it over your tailbone, lower spine, or pelvis. 4. Turn on your side and work on your IT bands. Lie on your right side so your hip rests on the roller; the roller should be just below your pelvis. Bend your right elbow 90 degrees and support your upper body with your right forearm, which should be flat on the floor. Keeping your right leg straight, cross your left leg over it, bend your left knee, and rest your left toes on the floor to keep your balance. Using your left foot and right elbow, slide your body to massage the side of your upper thigh between your hip bone and knee. Remember to roll soft tissue only; steer clear of the hip bone and knee themselves. Keep your core muscles engaged so your back stays straight. Roll slowly for 30 to 60 seconds, then switch sides. The IT bands run on the outside of your legs, and connect the muscles in your hips and lower back to your knees. Some physiotherapists and chiropractors believe the IT bands do not stretch and this could aggravate them. 5. Lie face down to loosen your hip adductors. Bend your elbows, use your forearms to support your upper body, and position the foam roller by your right hip so it’s parallel with your spine. Keeping your left leg straight, bring your right leg over the roller so it sits under your inner thigh. Relax your groin muscles as you place your body weight on the roller. Slowly shift your waist left and right to massage your inner thigh for 30 to 60 seconds, then switch legs. 6. Get into a plank position to target your quads. Lie face down and support your upper body with your forearms, which should be flat on the floor. Position the roller above your knees so your quads, or front upper thighs, rest on it. Bring your toes off of the floor so the roller alone supports your lower body. Using your forearms and elbows, slide your body forward and backward to roll your quads between your knees and pelvis. Remember to roll over muscle tissue only, and avoid rolling over your knee or pelvis. Try to relax your quads as you roll over them for 30 to 60 seconds. 7. Soothe the soles of your feet. To massage your feet after a long day or hard run, take off your shoes and stand with the arch of one foot resting on the roller. Gently lean your weight forward to place pressure on the foot, and slowly roll back and forth. Roll the first foot for 30 to 60 seconds, then switch sides.",

Place the roller across your mid-back. Interlace fingers lightly behind head; bring elbows slightly forward to open shoulder blades.\n2. **Start position**\n   Lift hips just off the floor. Brace your core and keep your chin gently tucked (neutral neck).\n3. **Slow rolls**\n   Glide from mid-back up to just below the base of the neck/shoulder blades. Move about 2–3 cm per second.\n   Do **5–10 passes**, pausing on tender (not sharp) spots.\n4. **Segmental extension (optional)**\n   On a stiff area, lower your hips, keep butt on floor, and gently lean back over the roller for **2–3 breaths**. Return, shift the roller 2–3 cm, and repeat.\n\n---\n\n## B) Lats (sides of the back)\n\n5. **Angle right side**\n   From the thoracic position, tilt your body ~30–45° to the right. Reach the right arm overhead to expose the lat.\n   Roll from just below the armpit toward mid-back. **5–8 slow passes.**\n6. **Angle left side**\n   Repeat on the left lat. Keep ribs down and core lightly braced.\n\n---\n\n## C) Glutes instead of lower back (for low-back relief)\n\n7. **Figure-4 glute roll**\n   Sit on the roller; cross right ankle over left knee (figure-4). Lean slightly toward the right hip and roll the glute/piriformis area for **30–60 seconds**. Switch sides.\n   *(This eases lower-back tension without rolling directly on the lumbar spine.)*\n\n---\n\n## D) Finish\n\n8. **Reset & stretch**\n   Sit up slowly. Follow with a gentle chest-opening stretch or child’s pose for **30–60 seconds**.\n9. **Frequency**\n   Use **3–5×/week**, or briefly after long sitting or workouts.\n\n---\n\n## Quick form cues\n\n* Move **slowly**, stay on muscle—not bones.\n* Keep **core engaged**; don’t flare the ribs.\n* Use your legs to control pressure; if it’s too intense, keep more weight on your feet/hips.\n\nIf you want, I can generate a second image focused just on the glute figure-4 variation or a printable one-page guide.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Place the block in front of your feet for a Standing Forward Fold. Standing with your ankles and knees aligned your hips, slowly fold your body from the hip joints, bending your knees slightly. Instead of reaching to touch the floor, put your hands on the block. Using this modification allows your body to relax more and puts less strain on your hamstrings. 2. Position the block under your hand for stability in Triangle Pose. Keep your feet wide, making the distance between them about the length of your leg. Stretch your arms to your sides so they are parallel with the ground. Turn the toes of your the foot closest to the front of the room 45 to 90 degrees to face the front of your mat. Place your back hand on your hip and ease your front hand down the shin and then onto the block. The block reduces the risk of over-extending hamstrings and joints while opening the chest. Avoid locking your knees in this position. 3. Rest your head on the block during a Wide-Legged Forward Bend. Standing with your feet just wider than your hips, place the block in front of you on the floor. Bend from the hips toward the floor, balancing your head on the yoga block to avoid overextending or straining. 4. Use the block to “elevate the floor” in any standing pose. When in a yoga pose that requires you to both stand and stretch toward the ground, the block adds height to the floor so that you can find your balance and settle into the posture. Balancing is a key part of practicing yoga that challenges beginners and experts alike. Even if you have practiced yoga before, poses may feel different from day to day, so feel free to keep a block nearby for days when you need it!",

Pick your block height\n\n* **Flat (lowest):** stable, subtle help.\n* **Mid (on its side):** moderate lift.\n* **Tall (standing up):** biggest lift; great if flexibility or balance is limited.\n\n2. General cues\n\n* Spread fingers on the block; press evenly.\n* Keep wrists stacked under shoulders when hands are on blocks.\n* If the block feels wobbly, choose a lower height.\n\n## Step-by-step uses\n\n1. Seated Forward Fold (Hamstrings)\n\n* Sit tall, legs long. Place a block flat in front of your feet.\n* Inhale lengthen; exhale place **hands on the block** (any height) and hinge at hips.\n* Keep spine long; avoid rounding. Hold 5–8 breaths.\n\n2. Low Lunge (Balance & Length)\n\n* From a lunge, put **both hands on blocks** beside the front foot (mid or tall).\n* Press down to lift chest and square hips. Option: straighten the back leg. 5 breaths.\n\n3. Triangle (Alignment)\n\n* Step wide; turn front toes out, back toes slightly in.\n* Slide your front hand to a **block outside the front foot** (height as needed).\n* Rotate chest open; reach top arm up. 5 breaths each side.\n\n4. Supported Bridge (Restorative/Core)\n\n* Lie down, knees bent. Lift hips and place a **block under the sacrum** (not low back).\n* Choose low/medium/tall height—lowest is gentlest.\n* Arms relax, breathe 8–12 breaths. To exit, press feet, remove block, lower slowly.\n\n5. Malasana Squat (Hips)\n\n* Turn toes out, heels in. Sit **on a block** (mid or tall) between your feet.\n* Bring palms together, elbows inside knees, chest lifted. 5–8 breaths.\n\n6. Hero’s Pose (Knees/Quads)\n\n* Kneel, feet outside your hips. Sit **on a block** between heels (height to comfort).\n* Lengthen spine; avoid pinching in knees. 1–3 minutes.\n\n7. Child’s Pose (Neck/Back Relief)\n\n* Knees wide, big toes touch. Place a **block under your forehead** (flat or mid).\n* Let neck soften; breathe into back ribs for 8–12 breaths.\n\n8. Supported Forward Rest (Desk/Chair variation)\n\n* Sit in a chair, feet flat. Put a **block on your thighs** (flat).\n* Fold and rest forehead on the block; breathe 1–2 minutes.\n\n## Safety & tips\n\n* If wrists complain, use lower height or place forearms on the block.\n* For tight hamstrings or hips, start taller; **progress to lower** over time.\n* Foam blocks = softer; cork = firmer (more stable).\n* Never force range—use the block to bring the floor **up to you**.\n\nIf you want a version tailored to your specific tight spots (hamstrings, shoulders, balance), tell me what you’re working on and I’ll customize the sequence.",

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use them effectively:\n\n**1. For Seated Poses (e.g., Sukhasana - Easy Pose):**\n\nIf you find your hips tight or your lower back rounding in seated meditation or easy pose, placing a yoga block under your sit bones can elevate your hips, allowing your spine to lengthen and your knees to drop more comfortably.\n\n**2. In Standing Forward Folds (e.g., Uttanasana):**\n\nIf your hamstrings are tight and you can't reach the floor with your hands in a forward fold, place one or two blocks under your hands. This brings the floor closer to you, allowing you to maintain a straighter spine and get a more effective stretch without straining your back.\n\n**3. For Supported Backbends (e.g., Setu Bandhasana - Bridge Pose):**\n\nFor a restorative and supported backbend, place a block horizontally under your sacrum (the flat bone at the base of your spine) during Bridge Pose. This allows you to relax into the pose, gently opening your chest and front body without active effort. You can use it on any of its three heights.\n\n",

However, keep in mind that some fitness experts see pulling your abs inward as counterproductive and instead recommend that you brace your abs. You can try both options and see which one feels like it is working better. Then, use your abs to gently lower yourself onto your back. Keep your back in its natural position without flattening it. This will help you do the dead bug in the most efficient and effective way. As you brace your abs, your back should be in its natural position with a slight curve in it. You should be able to fit a few fingers under the curve in your back. 2. Extend your arms. Raise your arms toward the ceiling.

Lower opposite arms and legs simultaneously. Choose an arm to lower first. Keeping your abs engaged, lower it and the opposite leg at the same time. Bring your arm and leg to just above the floor and return to the starting position. Move slowly to ensure that you engage the proper muscles and don’t use momentum. This also keeps you from raising your back off of the floor. 5. Repeat with the other arm and leg. Once you’ve finished your first arm and leg, lift and lower the other side. This ensures that you develop both sides of your abs and core evenly. [9] X Expert Source Steve Bergeron Personal Trainer & Strength Coach Expert Interview 6. Complete three sets. Gradually work yourself up to three sets of five or ten reps of the dead bug. You may only be able to perform one to start or do reps until your abs start shaking because they’re tired. Build onto your current sets as you are able.",

Bring arms straight up over shoulders, palms facing each other.\n* Lift legs to “tabletop”: hips and knees at 90°, shins parallel to the floor.\n* Gently draw ribs down and keep your lower back lightly touching the mat (neutral pelvis—no big arch).\n\n2. Brace & breathe\n\n* Inhale through your nose to expand the sides of your ribcage.\n* Exhale through pursed lips and “zip up” your abs (as if bracing for a cough). Keep this gentle brace throughout.\n\n3. Lower opposites (first rep)\n\n* As you exhale, slowly reach your RIGHT leg out toward straight, hovering 1–2 inches above the floor, while your LEFT arm reaches overhead.\n* Keep ribs down, low back from arching, and hips level.\n\n4. Pause & return\n\n* Hold the hover 1–2 seconds without losing your brace.\n* Inhale as you bring the arm and leg back to the start position.\n\n5. Switch sides\n\n* Exhale and repeat with LEFT leg + RIGHT arm.\n* Move slowly and with control; range of motion stays pain-free.\n\n6. Repeat\n\n* Do 6–10 reps per side, 2–3 sets. Rest 30–60 seconds between sets.\n\n### Form cues\n\n* Think “shorten the distance” between ribs and pelvis.\n* Keep your head/neck relaxed and gaze up.\n* If your low back starts to lift, make the leg reach shorter or higher.\n\n### Easier options\n\n* Heel taps (keep knees bent; tap one heel to the floor at a time).\n* Arms-only or legs-only.\n* Place a small towel under the low back to feel contact.\n\n### Harder options\n\n* Fully straighten the moving leg.\n* Squeeze a yoga block or ball between knees and hands while alternating.\n* Add a 2–3 second hold at the bottom of each rep.\n\n### Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Arching the lower back or flaring ribs.\n* Rushing the movement.\n* Holding your breath or straining the neck.\n\nIf you have back pain or a recent injury, check with a clinician before trying it.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Approach the shuttlecock with a forehand grip . Be on your toes and ready to return the shuttle with a smash at any instant. You never know when a smash-worthy shot will present itself. When the shuttle is hit to your end of the court, get underneath and behind it as quickly as possible. The sooner you reach the spot where the shuttle appears to be incoming, the higher it will be and the more time you’ll have to set up a killer smash. You may hear serious badminton players call this kind of maneuver “injection of pace.” All this means is that you add a boost of speed so you have more time to react. 2. Assume a surefooted stance. If the shuttle comes in hot, you might not have a lot of time to react. In ideal conditions, both of your feet will be pointing to the side of the court. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, your knees slightly bent, and your eyes tracking the ball. Balance is more important at this point than winding up for your smash. If you’re not well-balanced, it’ll negatively impact your smash. 3. Raise your arms and prepare to strike. Hold your racket upright and as far back as possible while still being comfortable. The arm of your non-racket hand should be bent at the elbow and the hand should be at about chin level. The fingers of your non-racket hand can be positioned however you like. Curling your fingers into a fist is most popular, but you can leave them spread out, too. As you prepare to strike, imagine the angle the shuttle will travel. It should be as steep downward as possible while still making it over the net. Raising your non-racket hand will act as a counterbalance for your racket hand, providing greater stability for your smash. 4. Strike the shuttlecock. Aim to connect with the shuttle at the highest point possible. Inhale deeply before you swing and stretch out your non-racket arm so it's roughly shoulder level. Swing with your full racket-arm and exhale as you do so. As you swing, your racket foot should shuffle forward. Power is important at this point, but even more important is hitting the shuttle with the center of the racket. When you feel the racket come in contact with the shuttle, snap your wrist downward. This will add power and steepness to the stroke. You can increase the power of your smash by contracting your abs at the same time you swing at the shuttle. 5. Follow through with your swing and recover for the next rally. An overhead smash will be much more difficult for your opponent(s) to return. But in the event they manage to get it back over the net, you’ll need to be ready to send it right back.",

Keep fingers loose so you can tighten at impact.\n\n2. Ready stance + split step\n   Face the net, feet wider than shoulders, knees bent, racket up. As your opponent hits, make a light split step to react.\n\n3. Move back & turn sideways\n   Chassé or scissor-step to the rear court. Turn your body so your non-racket shoulder points toward the net.\n\n4. Load the swing\n   Non-racket arm points up at the shuttle for balance. Elbow high, racket head drops behind you; chest and hips coil.\n\n5. Set your feet\n   Rear foot behind, front foot slightly open. If possible, prepare a scissor jump (rear→front) to transfer weight forward.\n\n6. Start the swing from the body\n   Uncoil hips and shoulders first, then the elbow comes forward. Keep wrist relaxed—don’t “push” with a straight arm.\n\n7. Contact point\n   Reach fully and strike the shuttle **slightly in front** of your body at your highest comfortable point.\n\n8. Pronation & snap\n   At contact, rotate the forearm (pronation) and whip the wrist. Think “throwing” the racket head through the shuttle.\n\n9. Follow-through\n   Let the racket continue across your body naturally; don’t stop it short. This preserves power and protects your shoulder.\n\n10. Land & recover\n    Land in a scissor (rear foot forward), take a small hop, and return to base ready for the next shot.\n\nQuick tips\n\n* Aim steep and fast rather than only flat and hard.\n* Mix in drop shots and clears so opponents can’t camp on your smash.\n* Common mistakes: panhandle grip, contacting too far back, swinging only with the arm, and failing to recover.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also provide a short practice plan (shadow swings → multi-shuttle → target cones) to help you master it.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Forehand Grip Start by positioning your racket in this manner for the basic grip. Then hold the racket handle using a “hand-shake’ grip. Do not grip too tightly. Gently hold the racket and you should still be able to move and twist the racket with flexible wrist movement. Clench tightly only when hit is executed. The ring and last finger are there to prevent racket slipping out of hands. This grip method is safe to be used in almost all forehand shots. 2. 2) Backhand Thumb Grip Players must be able to twist the racket fast enough in order to change and use different grip for backhand shots. With a backhand thumb grip, it will be easier for you to make the shot across the court. The front of the racket head must constantly be facing the incoming shuttlecock for a successful return to opponent’s court. Thumb should be placed correctly on the racket handle where the front of racket frame is. This is because your thumb is the main driver to push the racket for all backhand shots. Again, clench loosely on the handle and tighten only when hit is executed. 3. Unlike backhand thumb grip, bevel grip is more for applying defensive and deceptive shots. 4. Hammer grip is useful when you are executing jumping smashes. Remember how you hold a hammer?It simply starts with a forehand grip, rotate the grip swiftly to a hammer grip while you are swinging your arm during the jump and then tighten your grip when it’s time to hit the shuttlecock. Notice that you must not cover any fingers. 5. Net Tap Grip or Pan Hold Grip.This is the kind of gripping needed on the front court near to the net when the shuttlecock is returned very closely to the net. At just the right moment before the shuttlecock starts to descend, a short tapping action needs to be executed. Relax your fingers, gently hold the racket using thumb and fingers creating some space between racket handle and palm. You’ll be using your thumb, index finger and middle finger to do the tap.",

Let the “V” between thumb and index sit on the top bevel. Index finger slightly ahead; other fingers wrap relaxed. Keep a small gap (a “tunnel”) between the palm and handle.\n* Use for: Most forehand strokes (serves, clears, smashes, drops).\n* Common mistakes: Gripping too deep in the palm or squeezing hard all the time.\n\n2. Backhand Thumb Grip\n\n* How: From forehand, rotate the racket ~¼ turn so the string face leans slightly left (for right-handers). Place the thumb pad flat on the wide back bevel; curl the index lightly. Wrist neutral, not bent.\n* Use for: Backhand drives, pushes, and net shots.\n* Common mistakes: Thumb on the edge (not flat), or over-rotating into a panhandle.\n\n3. Bevel Grip (Backhand Clears/Drives)\n\n* How: From the thumb grip, rotate a little toward forehand so the thumb rests on the diagonal/beveled edge. Finger pressure still mainly on thumb and index.\n* Use for: Backhand clears, lifts, and around-the-head defense.\n* Common mistakes: Staying in full thumb grip (hard to angle the racket) or squeezing with the palm.\n\n4. Panhandle Grip (Situational)\n\n* How: Rotate farther so your palm faces the strings and the “V” sits on the flat face.\n* Use for: Forecourt net kills and quick interceptions directly in front of you.\n* Caution: Avoid using this for overheads—limits pronation and leads to poor technique.\n\n5. Pinch/Net Grip (Choked-Up Control)\n\n* How: Slide the hand up toward the cone and hold mainly with fingertips. Pinch with thumb and index to “tap” the racket; middle/ring support lightly.\n* Use for: Fast grip changes, tight net play, blocks, and quick drives.\n* Common mistakes: Holding too far down the handle or clamping with the whole palm.\n\nQuick tips\n\n* Keep grip pressure dynamic: relaxed (3/10) most of the time; squeeze briefly on impact.\n* Practice switching: forehand ↔ thumb ↔ bevel with small micro-rotations using the fingers, not the wrist.\n* Align the racket face: think “edge leading” during preparation, then square to the shuttle at contact.\n\nIf you want, I can generate separate images for each grip instead of the single 5-panel poster.\n",

    "Gemini_text": "Here are 5 visual methods for holding a badminton racket correctly, along with text explanations:\n\n**1. Forehand Grip (Handshake Grip)**\n\nBegin by holding the racket face perpendicular to the floor, as if you're shaking hands with the racket. Your thumb should rest comfortably on the wider bevel of the grip, and your fingers should wrap naturally around it. This grip is primarily used for forehand shots.\n\n**2. Backhand Grip (Thumb-Up Grip)**\n\n For backhand shots, rotate your hand slightly from the forehand grip so that your thumb is pressing firmly against the flat, wide surface of the grip. This position provides better leverage and power for backhand strokes.\n\n**3. Basic/Neutral Grip**\n\n For the basic or neutral grip, hold the racket loosely but firmly. The \"V\" shape formed by your thumb and index finger should point towards the top edge of the racket frame. This is a versatile grip for quickly transitioning between forehand and backhand.\n\n**4. Loose Grip (For wrist flexibility)**\n\nWhile playing, avoid gripping the racket too tightly. A slightly looser grip allows for more wrist movement and flexibility, which is crucial for generating power and deception in your shots. Only tighten your grip just before impact.\n\n**5. Finger Spacing (For control)**\n\n Pay attention to the spacing of your fingers. Spreading your fingers slightly along the grip can provide better control and feel of the racket, allowing for more precise shots. Avoid clumping your fingers together too tightly.",

    "text_ref": "1. Stand inside a service court, not touching any boundary lines. If any part of your body touches a service line, your team will be at fault and your serve will not count. The service court you use will depend on whether you are playing singles or doubles and the side of the court will depend on your score. If you are playing singles, stand 2–3 ft (0.61–0.91 m) behind the short service line, which is the line closest to the net. If you’re playing doubles , stand 2–3 ft (0.61–0.91 m) behind the inside back line. This isn’t the very back line, but the next one in. 2. Serve from right to left if your score is an even number, and vice versa. The direction of the serve depends on the score . If your score (or your team’s score in doubles) is an even number, or at the beginning of the game, you will serve from the right service court, and you should hit the ball towards your left. [2] X Expert Source Derrick Ng Badminton Coach Expert Interview Your serve will only be in if it lands in the diagonally-opposite side of the court. If your score is an odd number, serve from the left service court. 3. Don’t lift your feet off the ground during the serve. Badminton rules state that you have to keep at least some part of both of your feet on the ground while you’re serving. Your back left foot will naturally lift as you swing the racket, but be sure to keep your toes on the ground! [3] X Expert Source Derrick Ng Badminton Coach Expert Interview The rules also state that you should not drag your foot along the ground during the serve, although you can pivot. 4. Hit each shot from below your waist. When you're serving, the shuttle must be below the bottom of your rib cage, otherwise the hit is considered illegal. Overhanded serves like you see in tennis or volleyball are not permitted. [5] X Expert Source Derrick Ng Badminton Coach Expert Interview 5. Vary your serves so they won't be predictable. If you hit a low serve every shot, for instance, your opponent will begin to expect them. Mix up your shots between low serves, high serves, flicks, and drives, so your opponent will always be left guessing where your next serve will go.",

Ready stance\n\n* Stand in your service court, feet shoulder-width, non-racket foot slightly forward.\n* Knees soft, torso relaxed, eyes on the target service box.\n\n2. Grip\n\n* Use a relaxed basic forehand grip for most serves (thumb on the wide bevel for a backhand serve).\n* Keep the racket head below your hand and loose in your fingers.\n\n3. Hold the shuttle\n\n* Hold it by the feathers with your non-racket hand.\n* Position it in front of your body, close to the racket face.\n\n4. Position & aim\n\n* Face slightly side-on to the net.\n* Aim diagonally to the opponent’s service box (serve must travel cross-court).\n* Make sure you’re inside your service court and not touching any lines.\n\n5. Backswing & weight\n\n* Make a small, smooth backswing.\n* Shift a little weight to your back foot; keep both feet still before and during contact.\n\n6. Drop & swing\n\n* Release the shuttle and swing in one continuous underhand motion.\n* Contact the shuttle in front of your body, below your waist, with the racket pointing upward.\n\n7. Contact & trajectory\n\n* For a **short (low) serve**: brush gently so the shuttle clears the net and lands just beyond the opponent’s short service line.\n* For a **high (deep) serve** (mainly singles): hit more firmly so it rises high and lands near the back boundary.\n\n8. Follow-through & recover\n\n* Let the racket continue forward naturally.\n* Step into the court and recover to a balanced “ready” position.\n\n## Service rules & placement tips\n\n* Serve diagonally; the shuttle must land within the correct service box.\n* Feet must be stationary at impact; don’t step on the boundary lines.\n* In **singles**, the service court is long-and-narrow; in **doubles**, serves must land before the long service line for doubles (shorter back line).\n* Vary placement: to the T (center), to the sideline, or just past the short service line.\n\n## Common faults to avoid\n\n* Double motion (pausing then swinging again).\n* Hitting above the waist or with racket head above the hand.\n* Striking the shuttle behind your body (reduces control).\n\nIf you want, I can generate additional panels just for **forehand low**, **forehand high**, and **backhand low** serves as separate images.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Get in a low stance. Tremblay advises that before you dribble, get in a low, defensive stance. [1] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview Spread your feet shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and drop your hips back slightly (as if you were sitting in a chair). Keep your head up and shoulders square. This position helps protect the ball while also giving you plenty of mobility. Avoid a tall, vertical posture. In this stance, the ball travels from your upper body to the ground and back again as it bounces, leaving it wide open for a defender to steal. Avoid bending at the waist (as if you were bending over to pick something up). Besides being bad for your back, this stance is fairly unbalanced, meaning it's easier to accidentally stumble forward. 2. Touch the ball with your fingertips, not your palm. Having good control over the ball when dribbling is key, but you don’t want to use too much arm strength. For the best results, avoid slapping the ball with your palm. Instead, handle the ball with the tips of your fingers. Spread your fingers out across the surface of the ball for a wider, more balanced contact area. Indiana Pacers’ player Paul George recommends against palm-to-ball contact, as it “slows down the whole dribbling process.” 3. Bounce the ball off the ground. Handling the ball with your fingertips, take it in your dominant hand and bounce it off the ground. Bounce the ball firmly, but not so hard that you use serious arm strength. Your dribble should be quick, yet steady and controlled. Each time the ball returns to your hand, without grabbing it or catching it in any way, make contact with your fingertips and push it back down with a controlled motion of the wrist and forearm—again, you shouldn't be tiring your arm out from dribbling. Aim the ball to hit the floor at a spot slightly to the side and ahead of the foot on the same side of your body as your dribbling hand. Avoid bouncing the ball too lightly, as this can make it easier for a defender to steal the ball. Be firm without using too much force. When practicing dribbling for the first time, it's OK to keep your eyes on the ball until you get the hang of things. However, the more you can look up, the better. 4. Keep your hand on top of the ball. When you dribble, it’s important to keep the motion of the ball under control. You never want the ball to get away from you, as this can give the other team possession of the ball for free. Keep the palm of your hand directly over the ball as you move so that the ball (on its “up” bounce) will bounce right into your fingertips. Another reason to focus on keeping your hand over the ball while dribbling is that momentarily “catching” the ball on its underside results in a penalty called a carrying violation. To avoid this, keep your palm over the ball and facing the floor as you dribble. 5. Keep the ball low. The shorter and quicker the ball bounces, the harder it is for your opponent to steal. One surefire way to make your ball’s bounces shorter is to bounce it closer to the ground. Keep your knees bent, drop your dominant hand down to the side of your leg, and dribble with low, quick motions, instructs Tremblay. [7] X Expert Source Ryan Tremblay Basketball Coach Expert Interview If you have to bend to the side to dribble in a low stance, you’re dribbling too low. In your low stance, the highest point of your bounce should be up to your hip. 6. Keep your head up. When you first start dribbling and the process isn’t intuitive yet, it's hard not to look at the ball as you dribble. However, it’s very important to practice looking up. During a game, you’ll have to look for your teammates, keep an eye on your defender, and be aware of where the basket is, all while dribbling. So, keep your head and gaze up. The more you practice, the more natural dribbling will become! Soon, it’ll feel like second nature, and you’ll be able to trust the ball without looking at it.",

Keep eyes forward (not on the ball).\n2. **Hand shape** — Spread fingers and use your finger pads, not your palm. Keep your hand on top/side of the ball; off-hand ready to shield.\n3. **Start the bounce** — Push the ball down with a snap of the wrist and fingers (don’t slap). Bounce slightly in front and to the side of your dribbling foot.\n4. **Control the height** — For beginners, keep it around waist level; for protection go knee-high. The ball should return to your hand without reaching.\n5. **Find a rhythm** — Keep a steady tempo and consistent height. Relax your shoulders; absorb the ball with soft fingers.\n6. **Move with the ball** — Step and glide while dribbling. Keep the ball outside your shoe line so you don’t kick it.\n7. **Change hands (crossover)** — Push the ball low across your body at about knee height, switch to the other hand, and shift your weight.\n8. **Vary speed and level** — Mix slow-to-fast bursts and change from high to low dribbles to keep defenders off balance.\n9. **Protect the ball** — Dribble on your outside hip; use your body and off-arm (bent, legal) to shield.\n10. **Finish under control** — When stopping, lower your hips, take a short “gather” bounce, then pick up for a pass or shot.\n\n**Quick drills (optional):**\n\n* Pound dribbles R/L, 30 seconds each.\n* Low-to-high ladder: ankle → knee → waist → knee → ankle.\n* Stationary crossovers, 20–30 reps keeping it low.\n* Walk the court dribbling while keeping your eyes up.\n\n**Common mistakes:** Looking down, slapping with the palm, bouncing too high/far in front, standing tall, letting feet come together.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Do a Layup in Basketball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Dribble close to the basket with your right hand. Since you're doing a right-handed layup, angle your approach toward the right side of the basket. You want to get close enough to have easy access to the basket, but not so close that you end up directly under it. Layups are often taken off of a running dribble. Practice approaching the basket slowly at first, and increase your speed once you've got the footwork down. You can do a right-handed layup if you're starting near the center or right side of the basket. If you're approaching the basket from the left, you'll want to do a left-handed layup. 2. Step toward the basket with your right foot. When you're just a few feet from the basket, take a step toward it with our right foot. Use this step to gain distance and position yourself within easy shooting range. Dribble the ball one last time just outside your right foot. 3. Jump off of your left foot. As soon as your left foot lands, use it to jump in the direction of the basket. Your body should be moving toward the basket, but don't lean forward. Ideally, you'll be positioned close enough to the basket that you can jump straight up to take your shot. As you jump, bring the ball out of the dribble to your chest to prepare for the shot. 4. Shoot with your right arm as you lift your right leg. As you jump, imagine a string attached to your right arm and your right leg. Move them at the same time as you shoot, as though someone were pulling upward on the string. Your right knee should be bent and pointed toward the basket while your right arm moves up to shoot the ball. Arch your arm toward the basket. Shoot with your elbow slightly bent, so that your arm looks like the neck of a swan. When you're doing a layup, the shooting technique is slightly different from that of a regular shot. Instead of using your left hand to steady the ball, you want to shoot the ball using only your right hand. This gives you more reach, and since you're so close to the basket that it's difficult to miss the shot, you don't really need your left hand to steady the ball. As you shoot, slightly rotate your wrist inward to give the ball a little bit of spin, rather than snapping your wrist forward as you would for a regular shot. The gentle spin will keep it from hammering off the rim or backboard with too much force. 5. Aim for the sweet spot on the backboard. One of the reasons a layup is such a sure bet is because you can always use the backboard to help ease the shot into the basket. When you're doing a right-handed layup, the sweet spot is slightly above the top right corner of the small square in the center of the backboard. This spot absorbs the impact of the ball and drops it right down through the net. You'll get two points no matter how you make your shot, but it's better to aim for the backboard instead of trying to just tip the ball over the rim. The backboard allows more room for error, but if you hit the rim funny the ball will bounce right out. There's nothing worse than missing a wide-open layup when you have full access to the basket, so work on hitting that sweet spot every time. 6. Practice until your muscles remember the movement. The layup is a fundamental basketball move that will become second nature after you practice it enough. You should get to the point where your body remembers what to do and you don't have to think about which foot to put forward and which one to jump off: you just do it. Do layups as part of every basketball practice . As you practice, you'll start to get a good sense for how fast to approach the basket and from what distance to begin your layup footwork and launch into a jump. Work on doing layups while you're being defended or off of a long pass.",

    "prompt": "How to Do a Butterfly Stroke in Swimming? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Use the correct arm movement. The arm movement in butterfly stroke can be broken down into three parts: the pull, the push and the recovery. Starting with your arms extended above your head (shoulder width apart), pull your hands towards your body in a semicircular motion, palms facing outwards. Remember to keep your elbows higher than your hands. This is the pull. At the end of the pull, begin pushing your palms backwards through the water, along your sides and past your hips. This is the fastest part of the arm movement and provides the momentum necessary to complete the release. A good way to remember the pull and push sequence is to imagine making the shape of a large keyhole with your hands underwater. The pull is the wide part of the keyhole at the top, while the push is the narrow part of the keyhole at the bottom. The last part of the butterfly arm movement is the recovery which is where your hands must be positioned as they are in motion while finishing your pull and are getting ready to begin the subsequent stroke. Essentially your hands must reach your thighs. A good way to ensure that you have done this part of the stroke successfully is to drag your thumbs on your thighs as you are finishing the stroke. Next, sweep both arms out of the water simultaneously and throw them forwards into the starting position. Your palms should be facing outwards so your thumbs enter the water first, not your pinkies. Also, make sure the distance between your arms as you enter the water is no greater than shoulder width apart as this will greatly decrease entry drag allowing you to cut through the water more efficiently. 2. Master the dolphin kick. The dolphin kick is the name given to the dolphin-like kick of the legs used in butterfly stroke. Imagine kicking your legs like a dolphin (or a mermaid!) would kick its tail underwater. [5] X Expert Source Hayley Church Aquatic Manager Expert Interview With the dolphin kick, both legs move simultaneously, and should be pressed together to avoid a loss of water pressure. You should kick twice for each stroke of the arms in butterfly stroke. However, both kicks are not exactly the same - there is one small kick and one big kick. The small kick is performed while you are making the keyhole shape with your arms. This is because your arms are providing forward momentum in addition to your legs, so the kick doesn't need to be as strong. The big kick is performed during the recovery, when your arms come out of the water. During the recovery you tend to lose momentum, so you need a big kick to keep your body moving forwards. The most common mistake beginners make when performing the butterfly stroke is to kick in a uniform fashion, without alternating between small and big kicks. 3. Move your body in a wave-like fashion. It's not just your arms and legs that are required during the butterfly stroke, your whole body needs to get involved! [7] X Expert Source Hayley Church Aquatic Manager Expert Interview Practice moving your whole body in a wave-like fashion. Think about the way that a dolphin or mermaid moves in the water -- your body should form an undulating S shape as you swim. More specifically, when your chest rises your hips should be at their lowest position, and when your chest falls your hips should be at their highest position, with your behind breaking the surface of the water. If you can get your timing right and manage to synchronize your body movement with your arms and leg strokes, you will find the butterfly much easier to master. You will be able to swim faster and find yourself getting tired less easily. 4. Know when to breathe. Breathing during butterfly stoke can be a little tricky, as it has to be perfectly timed and completed pretty quickly. The correct point to take a breath during butterfly stroke is when your arms are just coming out of the water at the beginning of the recovery phase. As your arms are about to come out of the water, raise your head until your chin is just above the water and take a breath. Do not turn your head to the left or right - it should be kept straight. However, some swimmers who swim in the FINA World Cup do breathe to the side. This is not illegal, and may be more comfortable you. Begin by trying face forward, but try side breathing if you find it difficult after some time. As your arms recover drop your face back into the water and tuck your chin in so it touches above your chest. This will help you to lift your arms a lot higher. Avoid breathing on every stroke, if possible. Every time you lift your head out of the water to breathe, it will slow you down slightly. Try breathe to every other stroke, or even less if possible. Of course, on longer races you may have to breathe more, but balance your need for breath and for speed. 5. Put it all together. By combining all of the steps outlined above - the arm stroke, the dolphin kick, the body movement and the correct breathing technique - you will find yourself doing the butterfly stroke! However, bear in mind that this is a tough stroke to perfect and it will take time and practice before you are able to synchronize all of these movements and swim the butterfly stroke correctly. Learn good technique. Incorrect butterfly technique can lead to problems in certain muscles and joints, such as the rotatory cuffs in the shoulders if done for long periods of time. It will also make the butterfly stroke harder than it actually is. Use a coach. Learning butterfly stroke just by reading about it will not work any more than reading a book will teach you to ride a bike. A swim coach can walk you through the stroke in more detail. A coach will also be able to observe you while you swim and pick out any flaws in your technique -- in this way, a knowledgeable outside perspective could be invaluable in helping you to improve your butterfly. 6. Do a one-armed butterfly. The first drill you can use to practice your butterfly technique is the one armed butterfly. Start with your arms at the 11 o' clock position, or shoulder-width apart. Begin swimming, using the dolphin kick. On every fourth kick, complete a single stroke with one arm, keeping the other arm pointing straight ahead. While practicing this drill, you may breathe to the side, rather than lifting your head straight out of the water as you do in full butterfly stroke. Once you have completed a full length of the pool using a single arm, switch to the other arm to build strength and technique evenly. 7. Use repetitive arm strokes. This drill is great for improving balance and giving you more control over your stroke. Begin swimming using the dolphin kick, with your arms straight out in front, one shoulder-width apart. Instead of the regular arm stroke, practice doing two strokes with the right arm, followed by two strokes with the left arm, followed by two strokes using both arms simultaneously. 8. Practice your dolphin kick. This drill is great for understanding the rhythm of the dolphin kick, while also helping you to time your breathing better. Keeping your arms locked at your sides and your head underwater, propel yourself down the length of the pool using only the dolphin kick. Try to alternate between big kicks and small kicks, as described in the previous section, and to get a feel for the rhythm of the movement. Breathe on every fourth or fifth kick, synchronizing your body movement with your breathing in the way that feels most logical and natural. Once you have developed a greater understanding for the rhythm of the movement, you can add your arms back into the stroke.",

Body Line & Undulation\n   Keep a long, horizontal body with a gentle “wave.” Press the chest slightly down so hips rise; keep head neutral and look slightly forward/down.\n\n2. Hand Entry\n   Reach both arms forward just wider than shoulder-width. Enter fingertips first, hands flat, wrists soft, elbows higher than hands.\n\n3. The Catch\n   Tip the fingertips down and out, keeping elbows high to “grab” the water. Forearms become paddles pointing slightly inward.\n\n4. First (Small) Kick + Chest Press\n   As the hands set the catch and the chest presses, deliver a small, quick dolphin kick from the hips (knees soft, feet together).\n\n5. Power Pull + Second (Big) Kick\n   Sweep in toward the midline, then press straight back to the hips. Accelerate the stroke. Time the larger kick as the hands drive past the ribs toward the thighs.\n\n6. Breathe Low\n   As the pull finishes and shoulders naturally rise, lift the face just enough to clear the lips. Keep the chin low (think “peek over the water”), inhale quickly, then put the face back in.\n\n7. Arm Exit & Recovery Over Water\n   Hands exit close to the thighs; relaxed, mostly-straight arms swing low and wide over the surface. Keep shoulders loose; avoid lifting the head.\n\n8. Re-entry & Rhythm\n   Re-enter hands softly in front of the shoulders and flow into the next catch. Maintain the 2-beat pattern: **kick–catch, kick–recover** with a smooth body wave.\n\n**Quick Cues**\n\n* “High elbows, press back.”\n* “Kick from the hips, not the knees.”\n* “Breathe low, eyes down.”\n* “Soft recovery, wide entry.”\n\n**Common Mistakes to Avoid**\n\n* Lifting the head too high to breathe (hips sink).\n* Bending knees aggressively (creates drag).\n* Pulling straight down instead of back.\n* Entering hands too narrow or too deep.\n\n**Helpful Drills (optional)**\n\n* Body dolphin (no arms) to feel the wave.\n* Single-arm butterfly with the other arm forward.\n* 3-3-3: three right, three left, three full strokes.\n* Kick on back with arms at sides to ingrain hip-driven kick.\n\n---\n\n**Visual Steps:** I’ve generated an infographic illustrating these 8 steps.

    "prompt": "How to Swim Freestyle? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Perfect your hand placement and entry. To begin your stroke, your hands should be relaxed and your fingers should be held together. Put your hand into the water fingers first about 15 inches above your head. Your palm should be tilted at a 45 degree angle facing out so your index and middle finger enter the water first. Your wrist should be tilted down and positioned above the fingers, and your elbow will be raised above the wrist. Your hand should make as little splash as possible during entry. Once your hand is in the water, extend your arm another 4 inches Once your hand is in the water, press your hand down and out with your fingers spread out slightly. This is called “getting a feel” for the water or “the catch”. If you want to work on your hand technique, you can wear hand paddles to help you concentrate on how your hands are entering and exiting the water. Avoid putting your hand into the water just above your head. It will slow you down and hurt your technique. Do not smack the water with your arms, instead, once your hand enters the water, follow the motion and glide your arm into the water. 2. Work on your downsweep. Your arm will act as a lever during this phase of the stroke. As you stroke, your body will rotate toward the arm that is in the motion of stroking. Move your forearm and hand downward and back with your elbow held at about a 45 degree angle. Your elbow should stay high in the water during this phase of your stroke. Concentrate on going through the downsweep smoothly. This phase should happen in a rapid motion. However, avoid trying to go faster during this phase because it won’t propel you forward much but could create drag. 3. Pull your hand and forearm toward the center of your body for the insweep. During this part of the stroke, use your hand like a paddle and move as much water as possible. This is where you start to move your body forward with your arm stroke movement. It is the first part of the “propulsive” phase. And your upper arm will move inward toward your chest and ribcage. Your elbow will go starting moving into a 90 degree angle. When your hand starts to approach the midpoint of your body, you have reached the backsweep. Keep your arms closer to being under you instead of stroking at your sides. 4. Push your arm in an up, out, and backward motion to backsweep. This is the second “propulsive” phase where you can gain speed in your stroke. Right as your hand gets to the midpoint of your body you will stop pulling and start pushing water. Keep pushing water out and up until your arm hits the line of your thigh. This part of the stroke will be the most rapid phase and can be the most powerful at propelling you forward. 5. Move your elbow out of the water until it is pointing up for the release. During the release your arm doesn’t move you forward, but it does provide support for the arm which is pulling underwater. It is important to work on your release technique so that your hand entry is clean. To end your stroke, launch your hand forward in line with your shoulder out of the water. Your fingers should hang loosely above the water and your hand should swing wider than your arm. Your arm should be relaxed and should swing wide, too. Concentrate on rotating your arm forward, and do not force a down rotation at the end of the release. 6. Flutter kick just below the surface of the water. Although kicking accounts for only 10-15% of the power in your stroke, it is still an important part of your freestyle technique. Keep your hips close to the surface of the water and make a series of quick kicks. You want to focus on minimizing drag while you propel yourself forward; therefore, your kicking range of motion should be narrow. Your legs should not kick out of the water and neither should they break below the line of your body. Kick from the hips and thighs. Do not kick from your knees, this is called a bicycle kick, and it will cause more drag. You may slightly bend your knees while you kick, but this should not be where your power is coming from. 7. Use the two-beat kick. The two-beat kick requires less power and is used by long distance and middle distance swimmers. You kick one leg per stroke cycle. One stroke cycle means the stroke of one arm. Kick one leg in conjunction with the insweep of the opposite arm. (The insweep is when the arm starts pulling water toward the midsection of the body.) If you can think about how your arms and legs sync while you are walking, how your arm moves forward at the same time as the opposite leg, you can imagine how your kicking should be synced with your arm stroke in a similar way. The six-beat kick requires that you kick three times per arm stroke cycle. The third beat of the kicking cycle will start during the recovery phase. This is a faster kick that is used by faster swimmers . 8. Point your toes while you kick. If your toes aren’t pointed while you kick then there will be extra drag caused by your exposed forefoot. Your toes should face inward, and your big toes should come close to touching as you kick. When you point your toes, you are exercising the flexibility in your ankles. If you are having difficulty with ankle flexibility, consider using mid-length flippers to practice your kick. You can focus on both your freestyle arm and leg techniques more easily with the extra propulsion that flippers provide. But only use your flippers to help train your feet during drills. 9. Rotate your body in line with your arm stroke. Rotating your body correctly will help you with many important aspects of your stroke. First, you can put more power into your arm stroke. Second, you will minimize drag. And third, it will enable you to breathe correctly. As you rotate your body left and right with your alternating arm strokes, your body should be moving in the water about 30 degrees from the surface on both sides. Remember to swim mostly on your stomach and not on your side. Rotate your body forward as well. Your arm and shoulders should extend forward and your body should rotate forward after your hand and arm have entered the water. Your fully extended shoulder should stay tucked near your cheek. Do not move your shoulder further away from your body, or this will cause drag. Focus on rotating your body from the hips and not from the shoulders. 10. Rotate your body to the surface, and inhale through your mouth. This will allow you to keep your neck muscles and your head relaxed. If you turn just your head, you can put unnecessary stress on your neck. Keep your forehead and the crown of your head slightly submerged while you breathe. Imagine you have a wine glass balanced on the side of your head that you cannot spill. Do not over rotate. You only want tilt your body 30 degrees in one direction or the other. Do not hold your breath longer than you need to when you swim. Breathe at every stroke if you feel the need. Do not lift your head up- this will cause your hips and legs to fall, and you will have to work to regain your balance. Continue to keep your body and arms outstretched while you breathe. Keep your body straight, and do not lose your extension while you breathe. 11. Blow bubbles out of your mouth and nose to expel your breath. If you hold your breath, you may develop feelings of anxiety while you are swimming that will slow you down and distract you. You can practice blowing out bubbles in shallow water. Exhale 70% through your mouth and 30% through your nose. And exhale the last 20% with more force. Submerge your face and sigh or hum through your nose or mouth to create a stream of bubbles. While underwater, make sure to exhale out all of the air so that you are not having to exhale any last bit of air when you should be inhaling. 12. Hold your forehead just under the water while you swim. The water should rest between your hairline and your eyebrows. Keep your neck and upper-back muscles relaxed while you swim. Your head should be cocked about 45 degrees forward. If you move your head down too much toward your chest, it will cause more resistance. 13. Practice your stroke and breathing techniques. Work on isolated parts of your stroke and breathing techniques through practice drills on land and in the water. Concentrating on different parts of your stroke that you need work on will help you develop a stronger complete stroke. Practice your arm stroke, body rotation and head position on land. Bend forward at your waist, and go through the five stages of the arm stroke: entry, downsweep, insweep, backsweep, release. Practice rotating your body correctly, and practice keeping your head still at the side when you breathe. Rotate your shoulders to work on a longer stroke. Over exaggerate the rotation while you practice, and it will help create muscle memory for when you swim. Do breathing drills. Kick off the wall and keep your right arm extended in front of you. Use your left arm to stroke, and on your second stroke, take a breath on your left side. Practice blowing bubbles out of your mouth and nose completely and inhaling a full breath through your mouth. Then alternate sides and do the same drill on your right side. This will help you become comfortable with your inhaling and exhaling techniques and establish a breathing pattern. Concentrate on only rotating enough for you to get a full breath. Practice kicking drills. Push off the wall with your feet and extend your hands and arms out in front of you. Keeping your head underwater, kick vigorously for as long as your breath will last. You do not want to focus on going fast, instead, try to focus on your technique. Keep your toes pointed, your feet pointed inward so your toes are almost touching, your hips up, and your kick high. Keep your legs relaxed, and kick from your thighs. Repeat this drill 3-4 times. 14. Wear goggles while you are swimming. You do not have to wear goggles to swim freestyle; however, when you have to close your eyes while you swim, it can make you anxious. And it will make it more difficult to concentrate on your stroke. When you wear goggles, it can help you stay balanced and oriented. You will know when to stop because you will be able to see the walls of the pool, and you won’t have to worry about bumping into other swimmers.

Adjust the nose bridge. Pull on both sides of the strap if the nose bridge is a strap. The nose bridge fits properly if you press your goggles up to your eyes and they suction to your eyes without a problem. Fit the goggles to your head by putting the eye cups up to your eyes so that they suction to your face, and then with your thumbs, move the strap behind your head so that your goggles are firmly in place.",

Body alignment\n\n* Float long and narrow: head neutral, eyes down; waterline at your forehead.\n* Press your chest slightly, keep hips high, core gently engaged.\n\n2. Relaxed breathing pattern\n\n* Exhale slowly through nose/mouth whenever your face is in the water.\n* Inhale quickly through the mouth when you roll to breathe; one breath every 2–3 strokes is common.\n\n3. Body roll (rotation)\n\n* Rotate your torso about 30–45° side-to-side with each stroke—powered by the hips and core.\n* Keep the head still; let the body roll bring your mouth to air.\n\n4. Hand entry & extension\n\n* Enter fingertips first, in line with your shoulder, elbow slightly high.\n* Slide the hand forward just below the surface—don’t cross the midline.\n\n5. Catch\n\n* Spear the fingertips downward, bend the elbow to keep the forearm vertical (“early vertical forearm”).\n* Feel pressure on your palm/forearm.\n\n6. Pull & push\n\n* Pull straight back alongside the body, keeping the elbow higher than the hand.\n* Finish the stroke past the hip with a firm push.\n\n7. Recovery\n\n* Exit thumb-first by the hip; relaxed wrist and forearm.\n* Lead recovery with the elbow high, fingers soft, arm swinging forward over the surface.\n\n8. Flutter kick\n\n* Small, fast kicks from the hips; toes pointed, knees soft.\n* Keep amplitude compact (about 6–12 inches/15–30 cm).\n\n9. Timing & rhythm\n\n* Start the catch as the recovering arm passes your head—smooth, continuous propulsion.\n* Match a steady kick (2-,\n    4-, or 6-beat) to your stroke tempo.\n\n10. Common fixes\n\n* Sinking legs → press chest, look down, kick smaller/faster.\n* Crossing over → enter in line with shoulder, use pool “T” tiles as a guide.\n* Late breath → start turning to air as the pulling arm passes your shoulder.\n\nIf you want, I can also give you a simple pool drill plan (catch-up,\n    6-kick switch, fingertip drag, sculling) to practice these steps.",

    "prompt": "How to Swim Backstroke? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Keep your body flat like a plank. When you're doing the backstroke, you want your body to lay as flat on the surface of the water as possible. The smaller your profile in the water, the less resistance you'll feel as you swim and the easier it will be to go fast. Most people have a hard time getting their hips to float on the surface of the water, so they sink down a little below the surface. This is OK but try to keep your hips as close to the surface as possible. It will be easier to keep yourself flat once you are moving. 2. Be comfortable with the water covering the sides of your head. The backstroke (like most swimming strokes) is all about making the most efficient use of your energy possible. One easy way to do this is to let your head sit semi-submerged in the water. The water should cover your ears almost completely. It may touch the corners of your face, but it shouldn't be getting into your eyes, nose, or mouth. If you don't like the feeling of the water covering your ears, consider investing in a swimming cap or a set of swimmer's earplugs. Trying to keep your ears out of the water will tire out your neck and spend energy that you could be using to swim. 3. Use a \"flutter\" kick. As soon as you're in position on your back, start kicking. Your legs should be straightened, close together, and lined up below your hips. Use short kicking motions to propel yourself forward. [2] X Expert Source Brad Hurvitz Certified Survival Swimming Instructor Expert Interview As you raise one leg, kick the other down (and vice versa). For best results, keep your legs straight and kick from your hips rather than from your knees. This will give you more power and prevent you from getting sore knees. 4. Use a long, fluid arm motion. As you start to kick forward, keep your arms at your sides. Reach one arm up in front of you. It should point toward the sky or ceiling. Bring it up over your head, by your ear, and down into the water — it will be pointing in the direction you're traveling. When your arm hits the water, bring it down and scull outward to propel yourself forward. As you do this, raise the other arm and perform the same motion. Repeat. This should feel natural. Try to keep a steady rhythm between your arms and legs because that will make your swimming faster and easier! 5. Position your hands to minimize resistance. To swim as efficiently as possible, it is important to remember that your hands should enter and exit the water with their edges first, not their palms. When you lift your arm out of the water, lead with your thumb. When it enters the water, lead with your pinky finger. 6. Rotate your shoulders and hips with each stroke. Your motions in the pool shouldn't be rigid like a steamboat. Instead, keep them fluid and flexible to get through the water as efficiently as possible. See below: As you raise each arm, rotate your shoulder upwards. Rotate the opposite shoulder downwards — you should be using it to pull the other hand under the water. Similarly, twist your hips slightly with each kick. You should have an ever-so-slight \"wiggling\" motion — your right hip should go down when your right leg kicks and vice versa. 7. Breathe once per arm cycle. A good policy is to breathe in as one arm leaves the water, then breathe out as the other leaves the water. Repeat this pattern with deep breaths to keep your breath steady. Deep, steady breathing is important even though the backstroke allows you to breathe whenever you want. Breathing at a regular pace allows you to keep your backstroke up (with good form) for as long as possible. 8. Use flip turns to turn around quickly. As you approach a wall, turn over on to your front so you can see where you're going. Make sure to get a stroke count (the number of backstroke strokes it takes you to get from the flags to the wall), as it will help greatly with your flip turn. When finding your stroke count, count from the flags all the way until you hit the wall. Try taking one stroke off of your stroke count when you do your flip turn. Experiment a little bit, and see what works and is the most comfortable for you. Once you've figured your stroke count, as you take your last stroke on your back, gradually flip your body over, and simultaneously take one freestyle stroke, and use the stroke to pull yourself into the wall. This motion might feel a bit awkward at first, but keep practising it, and it will soon feel natural. Then, somersault forward underwater, then stretch your legs out to plant your feet on the wall. Kick off with your legs as you squeeze your arms to your ears and make a \"point\" with your hands. Stay in a tight streamline until you resurface. Keep up a streamline kick until you break the surface, then start your stroke again. It can take a little practice to learn when exactly to turn over onto your front. Ideally, you want to do it when you're just a stroke or two from the edge of the pool. 9. If indoors, use the ceiling to keep yourself straight. When you're swimming in an indoor pool, you can use the ceiling to make sure you don't veer off-course. Look for a line or pattern in the ceiling material. As you swim, keep your eyes open and focused on the ceiling. Keep this pattern oriented the same way as you swim to keep yourself travelling in a straight line. If you're swimming outside, you have fewer options. If there are clouds out, you can keep the clouds oriented the same way to travel in a straight line. If not, try keeping the sun on the same side of your body. Keeping your bearings when it's overcast is difficult since you have few visible reference points.",

Squeeze glutes and keep a straight line from head to heels—no bending at the waist.\n\n2. Head & hips\n   Keep the head still and neutral (chin slightly tucked). Lift hips to the surface; think “belly button to the sky.”\n\n3. Flutter kick\n   Straight legs with a small, fast kick from the hips (not the knees). Ankles relaxed, toes pointed. Kick is continuous.\n\n4. Hand entry\n   One arm recovers straight over the shoulder. Enter pinky-first just outside the shoulder line, arm straight, hand slicing the water.\n\n5. Catch\n   As the hand goes underwater, rotate the palm to face your feet and bend the elbow to set a firm “catch” on the water.\n\n6. Pull + body roll\n   Press water toward your feet with a high elbow as your body rolls slightly toward the pulling arm (about 30–45°). Power comes from roll + pull.\n\n7. Exit & recovery\n   Finish the pull by pushing past the hip; thumb brushes the thigh. Hand exits the water and recovers straight over the shoulder, relaxed wrist.\n\n8. Timing (opposition)\n   Arms move in opposition: when one hand enters, the other is exiting by the hip. Keep the kick steady underneath it all.\n\n9. Breathing & sighting\n   Breathe naturally—steady inhales/exhales since your face is up. Occasionally glance back to sight the wall/flags to prep for turns or finish.\n\n10. Turn & finish\n    Count strokes from the backstroke flags (usually 5 m from the wall) to learn your distance. For a finish, keep one hand moving to the wall; for a flip turn, roll onto your stomach after passing the flags, do a forward somersault, push off on your back.\n\nQuick cues:\n\n* “Still head, high hips.”\n* “Pinky in, thumb out.”\n* “High elbow under water.”\n* “Small-fast kick.”\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid:\n\n* Entering thumb-first or crossing over the midline.\n* Big, slow kicks from the knees.\n* Holding breath or letting hips sink.\n\nSafety: Practice in a lane with a lifeguard/spotter if you’re new, and stop if you feel dizzy or short of breath.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also generate individual step images (one per step) or a printable poster version.",

    "prompt": "How to Do a Cartwheel? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Picture an imaginary line extending straight in front of you. Use this line as a guide while you perform your cartwheel. You can even use painter’s tape to create a real line across a carpet or a mat . Make this line several feet long. Try to stay on the line, as if the line is a balance beam. As you focus on the line, be sure to keep your form in mind, too. Make sure the area around your line is free and clear. Avoid practicing cartwheels near walls or pieces of furniture that you might run into. Injuries occur when you bump into something hard. Stretch your arms and legs before practicing a cartwheel. This helps to stretch out your muscles and reduces the risk of injury. 2. Lunge forward with your lead leg and raise your arms. Slightly bend your front leg at the knee and keep your back leg straight. Keep both feet pointing forward parallel to your imaginary line. Hold your arms straight up by your ears. A common mistake is to start a cartwheel while facing sideways. Make sure you’re facing forwards as you prepare and start for your cartwheel. That is the correct way. Either leg can be your lead leg. Sometimes, however, it's more comfortable to use one leg instead of the other—you can try to figure out which one by doing a series of handstands, some starting with your right leg in front, others with your left. Whichever leading leg feels more natural is the one you should use for your cartwheel.You can determine your leading by watching which leg in splits feels more comfortable. 3. Lower your arms towards the ground while raising your back leg. Keep your arms straight by your ears as you lower them down to bring your head and torso down as well. Only lower your arms about halfway to the ground. Bring your back leg up while keeping it straight so your body forms a “T” shape. This step requires balance. You may need to drop your leg several times before you find a balanced position you can hold. Don’t worry if you’re having trouble balancing. Once you get the hang of the cartwheel, you won’t have to hold this position for very long since it will all become one continuous and natural movement. 4. Place your hands on the mat as you turn your body sideways. Put down the arm on the same side of your body as your lead leg first. Then put your other arm down so they're spread about shoulder width apart, similar to the way they would be positioned for a handstand. Place both hands along the imaginary line. Think \"hand hand feet\" to help you process the cartwheel. For example, if you lunged with your right leg, place your right hand down first, then your left hand. Keep the fingers of each hand pointing away from your head. 5. Push off on your front leg, then bring your legs up in a V shape. Straighten your front leg as you push so your legs end up in the air, pointing straight upwards. Balance your weight on your arms with your hands shoulder-width apart on either side of your head. Keep your head and torso upside down and positioned directly over your arms. Use your shoulders and core for support. You won’t hold this position for long. Cartwheels should be performed in one fluid motion. Make sure to keep your legs straight the whole time. If you are a beginner, then you may want to practice more. 6. Lower your lead leg as you lift the first hand you put down off the mat. To complete the cartwheel, put your leading leg down first along your imaginary line. The first hand you placed on the mat will lift up naturally as your foot comes down. Bring your arm up by your ear to finish the cartwheel. Your weight should start to shift onto your legs. Keep your head and torso roughly parallel to the mat. 7. Bring your other leg down while lifting your other hand off the mat. Your other leg will follow the first as it comes down. Make sure to place your back foot behind your leading foot along the same imaginary line so both feet point back in the direction you came from. Your second hand will lift naturally off the mat, following the first hand. At this point, both your head and torso should be right side up, centered over your legs. A common mistake while cartwheeling is leaving your hands on the ground for too long. Make sure that your arms stay straight and by your ears as your chest and head come up at the end of the cartwheel. 8. Land in a lunge facing in the opposite direction. Position yourself so your original back leg is in front and slightly bent, while your original leading leg is behind you and straight, just like a lunge. Keep both feet pointing in the direction you came from. Make sure your arms are straight and pointing upwards, next to your ears. Position your torso in the same direction your feet are pointing.",

    "prompt": "How to Do a Roundoff? Show visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Prepare for the round-off by standing with your feet together and your arms at your sides. It may help to visualize yourself doing the skill to completion before you get started. 2. Run several steps. Beginning with whatever foot is most comfortable, take a few running steps. Most gymnasts find it easiest to take a quick hop with their weakest leg and their first running step with their stronger leg. Run just enough steps to reach speed necessary to complete the round-off and propel yourself into whatever move comes next, keeping in mind the space you need to complete your forward routine. For best results, you should use the same number of steps each time you practice and perform a round-off. 3. Raise your arms toward the end of your run. You are preparing to put your hands on the ground for the round-off. 4. Hurdle into a lunge. A hurdle is completed when you skip into your last step before you put your hands on the ground. In gymnastics, a hurdle is the transitional motion between a run and setting up for a skill. Remember to hurdle out, not up. Bend the knee you will use to step into the lunge and propel yourself into the round-off. 5. Lunge into the round-off. Bend your stronger leg so that if you were standing still you would be standing in a lunge position with your arms over your head. Then propel your body forward with the bent leg. In gymnastics, a lunge is the position used to initiate a tumbling or control skill.The lunge is recognizable because the front leg is bent and the back leg is straight. Keep your toes pointed straight ahead. If you toes are pointed left or right, your round-off will go in the opposite direction. 6. Extend your body before placing your hands on the ground. This will help to make your round off better and more powerful. 7. Keep your head between your arms. Lifting your head will disturb your balance and momentum and tucking it too close to your body will cause you to over-rotate your round-off. 8. Place your hands on the floor, perpendicular to one other. When making a round-off, the first hand goes down just like in a cartwheel , but the second hand is placed down almost perpendicular to the first, so that it can propel your body 180 degrees. Imagine a sideways \"T\" when placing your hands on the floor. The first hand you put down should be horizontal and the second hand vertical to achieve this \"T.\" Make sure you don't leap into the round off. Your second foot should not leave the floor before the first hand contacts the floor. 9. Bring your legs together just past the midpoint of the round-off. If your body represents a clock, you would bring your legs together in the 1 o'clock position. Snap your legs together as quickly as you can, but do not smack your heels together. Smashing your heels together could cause a points deduction in competition. 10. Push off the ground with your hands. If you got a good running start and brought your legs together as you began coming down from the round-off, you will have the momentum necessary to push off the ground. 11. Hollow out your body as you push off with your hands. This means you will bend at the waist, and your feet will be slightly lower than your hips. Many people make the mistake of piking or tucking their legs and letting their feet touch the ground while their hands are still on it. Push off hard with your hands, keeping your body banana shaped with feet before your hips, before your feet hit the ground. 12. Land with your knees bent, your arms up and your body still moving. This will prepare you for any tumbling skills you want to connect with your round-off. Both legs should finish at the same time, positioned together with your feet facing backward from their starting position. 13. Jump into the air with your arms raised after you land the round-off. This is the rebound, and the height you achieve will come from the power in your round-off. If transitioning to another move, the rebound will propel you into it. 14. Keep your back straight and your head facing forward. The roundoff will often transition directly into a back handspring or a back tuck. 15. Land with your knees slightly bent if the round-off is your last move. If you have to take more than one backward step, you are off balance and need to work on your control. Don't land too deeply by taking too large a step backward, but a small step may help you absorb the landing so you do not hyper-extend and damage your knees. For maximum points, stick your landing with your knees bent, arms up covering your ears and arch your back with your chest up and butt in.",

    "GPT_text": "# Roundoff (Gymnastics): Step-by-Step Text Guide\n\n*A roundoff is a cartwheel with a half-turn that finishes with both feet together, facing the direction you came from. Use a padded surface and a coach/spotter if you’re learning this for the first time.*\n\n---\n\n## Quick Safety & Setup\n\n* Warm up wrists, ankles, shoulders, and hamstrings.\n* Practice on a spring floor, tumble track, or panel mats.\n* Keep eyes open, core tight, and arms by your ears whenever you “reach long.”\n\n---\n\n## Steps (numbered to match the visual)\n\n1. **Start & Lunge**\n   Stand tall, arms by ears. Step into a *long lunge* (front knee bent, back leg straight). To choose a lead: If you cartwheel left, lead left; if you cartwheel right, lead right.\n\n2. **Hurdle**\n   From a small run or step-step, perform a light *hurdle* into your lunge—soft, quiet feet. Keep chest lifted and eyes forward.\n\n3. **Reach in a “T” Shape**\n   Lean forward from the lunge, arms reaching past the front foot. Body makes a strong “T”: straight line from hands through the back leg.\n\n4. **First Hand Down (Turned 90° Inward)**\n   Place the **lead hand** on the floor slightly in front of the front foot, **fingers turned inward 90°** (toward the midline). Push tall through the shoulder.\n\n5. **Second Hand Down (Turned 180° Backward)**\n   Place the **second hand** next to the first, **fingers pointing back toward your feet (180° turn)**. Legs are split long like a cartwheel; hips square.\n\n6. **Upside-Down Half-Turn & Block**\n   As your legs pass vertical, your torso/shoulders finish the half-turn. *Block* (push) through straight arms and active shoulders. Keep a tight, hollow core.\n\n7. **Snap-Down (Feet Together)**\n   From inverted, *snap* both legs down quickly together, aiming slightly behind you. Keep ribs in, chin neutral (don’t throw your head back).\n\n8. **Two-Foot Landing (Facing Back the Way You Came)**\n   Land on the balls of both feet at the same time, knees soft, hips under. You should now be **facing the opposite direction** from the entry.\n\n9. **Rebound**\n   Immediately *rebound* upward with arms by ears, tight core and straight body. Heels kiss the floor lightly.\n\n10. **Finish**\n    Settle to a controlled stand. Arms can lower to the side after the rebound.\n\n---\n\n## Lead-Hand Cheat Sheet\n\n* **Left-lead roundoff:** Lunge left. **Left hand** down with fingers turned **right** (90° inward). **Right hand** down with fingers pointing **back** (180°). Land feet together facing back.\n* **Right-lead roundoff:** Mirror the above. Lunge right → **Right hand** 90° inward; **Left hand** 180° back.\n\n---\n\n## Common Mistakes & Fixes\n\n* **Hands not turned:** Turn the first hand 90° inward, second hand 180° back to complete the half-turn.\n* **Bent arms / shoulder collapse:** Lock out elbows and *push tall* through shoulders; eyes between hands.\n* **Arched back:** Keep a hollow core (ribs down, glutes engaged) for a fast snap-down.\n* **Slow snap-down:** Drive heels down fast as the hips close; think “up then snap.”\n* **No rebound:** Finish with a tight, quick rebound to absorb force and set up the next skill.\n\n---\n\n## Helpful Drills\n\n* **Cartwheel → ¼-turn exit**, then gradually to a true half-turn.\n* **Handstand snap-downs** off a raised panel mat.\n* **Shoulder block drills** (handstand hops against a wall or on a floor line).\n* **Panel-mat roundoffs** to a soft landing or pit for confidence.\n\n> **Tip:** Film from the side to check: straight arms, hand turns, quick snap, tight rebound.",

Your arms should swing up as your lead leg extends forward.\n**Step 2: Hand Placement**\nAs your lead leg goes down, your hands should reach for the ground. Place them shoulder-width apart, fingers pointing towards the side (about 9 o'clock or 3 o'clock, depending on which way you're turning). Your body should form a straight line from your fingertips to your toes.\n**Step 3: The Handstand Arch**\nKick your legs up into a handstand position, maintaining a tight core and straight arms. As your legs come together overhead, slightly arch your back. This helps with the \"snap down\" action.\n**Step 4: The Rebound**\nAs your feet come down, push off the floor with your hands. Your legs should land together, almost simultaneously with your hands leaving the floor. Your arms should swing up, ready for the next skill (like a back handspring!).\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Raise the saddle to about hip level. The saddle of a road bike is adjustable to your height. Stand up straight beside the bike, holding it steady. Raise or lower the saddle so it is level with your hips. Sit on the saddle and straighten one leg on the pedal. If you can do it, then the saddle is at the right height. With the seat adjusted properly, you should be able to extend each leg and pedal without rocking to either side. 2. Position the pedals horizontally before you mount the bike. Before you climb onto the saddle, position the pedals so they’re lined up horizontally. This helps you get more power out of your downstroke when you start pedaling. This is the most useful position to start riding because it allows you to smoothly mount and push into a downward stroke of the pedal. It’s also okay to position the pedals diagonally from one another as long as they’re not in the vertical position. 3. Look forward and keep your head up. Your neck should not be tense but don’t hang your head down either. It’s important to be looking ahead of you for safety reasons, but also so your neck is comfortable. Extend your neck and slightly lower your chin. Use your peripheral vision to check the sides. Gently move your head around sometimes so your neck doesn’t stiffen up. 4. Allow your shoulders to hang relaxed. Avoid hunching forward with your shoulders tensed up. Let them hang and shrug them every so often to loosen them again. Learn to tell yourself on occasion to loosen your shoulders, as you’ll probably tense them over time. Your neck and shoulders are closely connected, so tilt your head to each side when you shrug your shoulders to loosen any tension in the neck muscles. 5. Ride with your elbows bent. You’ll be tempted to straighten your elbows sometimes, but this puts extra tension on your arm muscles. Keep the elbows close to your body rather than splayed out. Bent elbows also help absorb the shock of bumps, which can injure you if you keep your arms locked straight. 6. Keep your spine bowed slightly. Keeping your spine bowed helps activate your core muscles to support your upper body. Lean slightly forward in your seat, making sure not to rest on any bones. 7. Align your knees over your feet. Position yourself forward or backward on the saddle so there is a vertical line from your knees to the center of the pedal spindle. If your knees are too far forward, then scoot back. If your knees are behind your feet, scoot forward. Keep your knees directly above your feet.",

Bike fit (baseline)\n\n* Saddle: height so your knee is slightly bent at the bottom of the stroke; hips don’t rock.\n* Reach: on the hoods your elbows are softly bent, shoulders relaxed, and you can comfortably look ahead.\n* Bars/saddle tilt: bars roughly level; saddle very slightly nose-down or level for comfort.\n\n2. Neutral riding posture\n\n* Long, neutral spine; chest open; eyes looking down the road.\n* Shoulders down and away from ears; elbows bent ~15–30°.\n* Lightly brace the core; breathe deep and steady.\n\n3. Hand positions (rotate to stay fresh)\n\n* Hoods = default for control and braking.\n* Drops = lower, more stable for speed/descending.\n* Tops = easy spinning; avoid on busy/fast sections since braking is slower.\n\n4. Foot & knee alignment\n\n* Ball of foot over pedal axle; knees track over the second toe.\n* Ankle neutral to slight heel-down as you push; avoid toe-down stabbing.\n\n5. Smooth pedal stroke & cadence\n\n* Think “scrape back” through the bottom and “roll over” the top.\n* Aim ~80–95 RPM on flats; a touch lower on climbs if needed.\n* Keep pressure smooth—no dead spots or mashing.\n\n6. Shifting & gearing\n\n* Shift *before* the hill or stop, not during max torque.\n* Momentarily ease pedal pressure while the shift completes.\n* Use easier gears to keep cadence steady rather than grinding.\n\n7. Braking technique\n\n* Cover both levers; apply smoothly (rough guide ~60% front / 40% rear).\n* Hips slightly back, elbows bent, heels a touch down.\n* Do most braking in a straight line *before* the turn.\n\n8. Cornering form\n\n* Look where you want to go; eyes lead the bike.\n* Outside foot down with firm pressure; inside knee slightly in.\n* Let the bike lean under you; release brakes mid-corner.\n\n9. Climbing form\n\n* Mostly seated: hands on hoods, torso quiet, breathe rhythmically.\n* Stand for short bursts: hips centered over the bottom bracket, light hands, bike rocks slightly beneath you.\n\n10. Descending form\n\n* Lower torso, soft elbows, light grip; cover brakes without dragging.\n* Weight a touch rearward; keep pedals level (3 & 9 o’clock) unless cornering.\n* Scan far ahead; stay relaxed to absorb road buzz.\n\n**Quick self-check cues:** “Relax jaw/shoulders,” “Quiet hips,” “Spin smooth,” “Brake early.”\n**Safety:** Wear a helmet, obey traffic laws, and practice new skills in a quiet parking lot before taking them to traffic or group rides.\n\n(Your visual step infographic is shown separately above.)",

When your pedal is at its lowest point, your knee should have a slight bend, around 25-30 degrees. This allows for full leg extension without hyperextending.\n\n\n**Step 2: Maintain a Neutral Spine and Relaxed Shoulders**\nAvoid hunching your back. Instead, maintain a slight curve in your lower back and keep your shoulders relaxed and slightly dropped, not hunched up towards your ears. This helps absorb road shock and prevents neck and shoulder pain.\n\n\n**Step 3: Elbows Slightly Bent**\nYour elbows should not be locked straight. Keep them slightly bent to act as natural shock absorbers, absorbing vibrations from the road. This also allows for better control and maneuverability.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Perform a Jab in Boxing? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Get in the boxing stance. We'll use the left jab throughout this article -- for the right jab, everything is reversed. So for now, place your left foot in front of your right, with your feet angled in slightly, but still pointing toward your opponent. Put your hands up to protect your chin, tuck your elbows down, keep your chin down, and make sure your hips are above your feet. [1] X Expert Source Derrek Hofrichter Self-Defense Specialist Expert Interview It's important that you keep your body and hands relaxed. Have a slight bend at your knees and bring up your back heel just a bit. Bounce around, getting comfortable in the stance. Make sure your feet are around shoulder width apart and your front foot is pointing mostly forward and your back foot is pointing mostly out. Whatever foot is forward is the hand you're jabbing with. [2] X Expert Source Derrek Hofrichter Self-Defense Specialist Expert Interview The jab is a punch that comes straight out, being closer to your opponent than the cross. 2. Lean forward with your elbows in and your right hand a little higher than your left. Your right is protecting your chin, playing defense, while your left is up, waiting to strike. If you are taller than your opponent and it is unlikely that he will pull off a straight right to your face, you can keep it low for greater power and visibility. Otherwise, keep it at your chin ready to parry or block. You're in the optimum position right now for your jab. Now while the jab comes from your core and not your arm, it is important not to launch yourself with the jab. You won't get a better punch for it. You should feel a slight, natural rotation, but that's it. 3. Transfer your weight forward and jab. Simultaneously shift off your back (right) foot (but don't let it come off the ground) and put your weight onto your left, while throwing your left arm into a quick, powerful jab. Twitch your entire left side forward while ever so slightly lifting the heel of your left foot. As your hand comes forward, your body's weight should come forward at the same time . Keep your chin tucked in behind your shoulder. In fact, your shoulder should come to meet your chin, offering it even more protection than in your normal stance. Throw the jab straight out as if you're punching into a pipe. Keep your elbows in and aligned with your fist and the rest of your body. No part of you should needlessly stick out -- or you're asking for an easy hit. Drive the punch with your hips and shoulders. [3] X Expert Source Derrek Hofrichter Self-Defense Specialist Expert Interview 4. Be sure to rotate your palm down. When your hands are held at your chin, your thumbs are facing you. But when you go to jab, rotate your hands so that your palms are facing down, thumbs slightly lower than perfectly horizontal. [4] X Expert Source Derrek Hofrichter Self-Defense Specialist Expert Interview Think of it like a slight corkscrew motion. It's in that twist that there's power -- kind of like the cracking of a whip. Your rear hand is staying near your chin this entire time. It is there to protect you. 5. As soon as your fist reaches full extension, quickly pull it back to its original position. \"Quickly\" being the keyword here. You can either bring your back foot forward, encroaching on your opponent's space, or step back, putting the weight again on your back foot. But don't step back as you throw the jab, or it won't have any power. Tighten up your fist only upon impact. If you do it beforehand, you lose speed and power. It also wastes energy. And right after impact, relax again. Resume your boxing stance or get ready for your next move. 6. Expect some sort of counter-attack, with it being almost immediately. Your objective is if you are tall, to get in close enough to deliver a straight right cross. And, if you are smaller and more compact, you may need a few jabs to get in close enough for a Punch/hook, or uppercut. The jab will help you accomplish both of these. Even though it's not the strongest punch, it's the most useful. It's both defensive and offensive and is like a small spark of power with supremely accurate precision. It can interrupt combinations, gauge distances, and set you up for the knockout. It can also be very, very distracting. Experiment with yours in different circumstances.",

Extend & rotate\n\n* Punch straight from the chin on a direct line.\n* Elbow tracks behind the fist (don’t flare).\n* Rotate the fist so the palm turns down near full extension.\n* Protract (raise) the lead shoulder to shield your chin.\n\n5. Contact & breathe\n\n* Land with the first two knuckles, wrist straight.\n* Sharp exhale on impact. Keep the rear hand glued to your cheek.\n\n6. Retract & recover\n\n* **Snap back** along the same path—fast in, faster out.\n* Re-settle your stance and guard immediately; be ready to move or follow up.\n\n# Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n* Dropping the rear hand.\n* Overextending/locking the elbow.\n* Leaning your head over the front knee.\n* Telegraphing (pulling the hand back before you jab).\n* “Slapping” (thumb up, loose wrist).\n\n# Simple Drills\n\n* **Wall jab:** Stand facing a wall and jab so your glove just brushes it—trains straight path.\n* **Double jab rounds:** 3×2 min; focus on step-jab → quick second jab without loading.\n* **Level-change body jab:** Bend at the knees (not waist), jab to the body, then pop back to head-level guard.\n\nStay relaxed, keep it compact, and let the legs start the shot.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Climb with the gym-class technique. To climb a rope with the gym class technique, hold the rope in your hands. Keep your hands close together, with one on top of the other. Pinch the rope between your feet. Remove one hand and place it higher on the rope. Loosen your feet, but keep the rope between them, and bring your knees up to your chest. Pinch the rope again between your feet, and reach up with your other hand. Repeat until you’ve climbed the rope. 2. Climb a knotted rope. A knotted rope is one with large knots in it at regularly-spaced intervals. To climb the knotted rope, place both hands on the rope in a firm grip. Place your feet to either side of the lowest knot. Proceed with climbing as you would using the gym class method, but use the knots to push off with your legs when climbing. The knots function as small platforms on which you can rest and balance yourself. Depending on the intervals between each knot, you might be able to bring your legs up after securing your hands on the rope. For instance, with your hands extended as high as possible on the rope and your feet pinching the rope while resting on the knot, lift your feet up to the point where the next knot is. Pinch the rope tightly between your feet, then bring your hands up to a higher position. If the knots are spaced further apart, pinch the rope as tightly as possible between your feet and extend your legs. Place your hands as high as possible on the rope. Once you’ve fully extended your arms and legs, bring your legs up as high as you can. Then, pinch the rope tightly between them, then move your hands up along the length of the rope until your feet can rest on the next knot. Do not try to grab the knots with your hands. 3. Climb using the brake and squat method. Also called the S-wrap method, this technique is employed by the Marines, and requires trapping the rope between your feet and taking the pressure off your arms. Grab the rope with both hands. You can let the rope fall to one side, or let it dangle between your legs. Wrap the rope loosely around one leg. Do not wrap the leg entirely. Rather, let the rope wrap around the back of your calf and beneath the foot of one leg. Bring the end of the rope over the top of your other foot. Place the heel of the unwrapped foot with the rope on it over the toes of the foot that has the rope beneath it and press down hard. The rope will be trapped between your feet, and your feet will thus function as a kind of clamp to keep the rope stable as you proceed up the rope. Reach up with your hands to grab the rope, then loosen the space between your feet and pull up with your arms. Tighten the rope again between your feet as you climb. You may need to “reset” the rope between your feet as you climb if it fails to remain in a loose loop over your foot.",

    "GPT_text": "Here are the **text steps**, separate from the image:\n\n1. Warm up (3–5 min)\n\n* Arm circles, band pull-aparts, hollow-body holds, and light hangs from a bar/rope.\n\n2. Set hand position\n\n* Stand tall, grab the rope with hands shoulder-width, one above the other.\n* Keep wrists neutral; thumbs wrap around for security.\n\n3. Choose your foot clamp\n\n* **J-hook (most common):** Lift knees; step the rope onto top of your dominant shoe. Sweep the rope under that foot and trap it by stepping your other foot on top (like pinching a sandwich).\n* **S-hook (secure for beginners):** Wrap rope around the outside of your dominant leg, under the foot, then pinch it between both feet.\n\n4. Tall body, hollow brace\n\n* Squeeze glutes, ribs down, slight hollow. Eyes forward. This keeps you from swinging and saves grip.\n\n5. First pull + stand\n\n* Pull with arms to bring chest toward hands while simultaneously lifting knees to re-clamp higher.\n* Once the rope is clamped, **stand up on your feet** to rise—think “arms pull, legs stand.”\n\n6. Advance the hands\n\n* With weight now on your feet, briefly relax arms, **reach hands up** as high as you can (one over the other), re-grip, then repeat: pull → knee lift → clamp → stand.\n* Keep hands stacked close to the rope; elbows down, not flared.\n\n7. Descend safely\n\n* Slide hands down in small increments while keeping a light foot clamp for friction.\n* Never “freefall.” Control each slide; pause to re-clamp if needed.\n* For beginners, descend using the S-hook/J-hook the whole way.\n\n8. Beginner sets (strength focus)\n\n* 3–5 climbs of 8–12 ft (2.5–3.5 m), resting fully between.\n* Or 4–6 sets of: 10–20 sec **tough isometric hang** on the rope + slow 3–5 ft controlled lower.\n\n9. Progressions for more upper-body strength\n\n* **Seated starts:** Sit on floor, legs straight, pull to standing using minimal legs.\n* **Strict pulls:** From a locked foot clamp, do 1–3 strict “rope pull-ups” before each stand.\n* **Legless partials:** Start legless for 1–3 pulls, then clamp to finish.\n* **Full legless climbs (advanced):** Small, fast hand-over-hand pulls with constant hollow body; descend with micro slides (use a light foot catch if needed).\n\n10. Common cues & mistakes\n\n* Cues: “Pull–Knees–Clamp–Stand.” “Elbows down.” “Hollow body.”\n* Mistakes: Hands too wide, letting knees dangle (no clamp), swinging, dropping too quickly.\n\nSafety & setup\n\n* Use a crash mat and a spotter if new. Chalk or tape can help grip; wear long socks to prevent rope burn. Stop if you feel shoulder pain beyond normal effort.\n\nIf you want, I can also give you a 4-week rope-climb strength plan based on your current pull-up level.",

    "prompt": "How to Walk Correctly? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Keep your back straight and your head held high. Good walking posture will help you avoid injury and walk for longer. When you start walking, stand up straight, and look about 15 ft (4.6 m) in front of you. Keep your chin parallel to the ground, and move your shoulders naturally as you swing your arms. Relax your neck, shoulders, and back. Although your posture should be strong, your body should not be held too stiffly as you walk. Walking with good posture improves your blood circulation, and can even help lower your blood pressure. 2. Walk heel to toe. When walking, you should step forward with your foot. Let your heel land on the ground in front of you. Then, roll your foot forward, transferring your weight to the ball of your foot. With your other foot, raise your heel, push your foot off the ground with your big toe, and repeat the first process. Walking is different from running. Your feet should never lift off the ground completely at the same time. Find a stride that's comfortable for you. If you're losing track of the heel-to-toe motion, and aren't rolling your feet consistently, you may need to slow down. 3. Avoid hyperextending your knee. Maintain a slight bend in your knee when walking, especially if you're prone to hyperextending your knee when standing. This will feel strange at first, but eventually your knees will adapt. Hyperextending your knee means moving your knee backwards slightly when standing or walking. Some people may have a natural tendency to hyperextend their knees, but hyperextending your knee can cause increased stress to your joints. When walking, be conscious of your knees to avoid hyperextending them. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Go slowly up stairs, moving in slow and deliberate motions. Avoid wearing heels too frequently, as this can encourage knee hyperextension. 4. Keep your hips facing forward. As you walk, make sure your hips aren’t swinging from side to side. Keep them facing in front of you, holding steady as you walk. You may have to shorten your stride as you get used to doing this. [3] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Swaying your hips puts unnecessary stress on your hip flexors, which can lead to pain and cramping. 5. Engage your core as you walk. Make a conscious effort to engage your abs and the muscles in your torso. This will help keep your posture upright and your head held high. Swing your arms with a slight bend in the elbows if you want. Tighten your stomach muscles, and don’t arch your back forward or backward. [4] X Trustworthy Source Arthritis Foundation Main organization devoted to arthritis support and education Go to source 6. Take quick, not long, strides. When most people think of walking quickly, they often imagine themselves stepping in long strides. However, taking too long of a stride can hurt your lower back over time. Instead, take small, quick steps to pick up the pace. Since we all have legs of different lengths, our strides are going to be somewhat different. Use the stride that’s best for you.",

Stand tall\n\n* Grow through the crown of your head; lengthen the back of your neck.\n* Keep ribs stacked over hips.\n\n2. Head & eyes forward\n\n* Look 10–20 feet ahead, not at your feet.\n* Chin level; avoid jutting your head forward.\n\n3. Relax shoulders & swing arms\n\n* Drop shoulders away from ears.\n* Elbows bent ~70–90°; let arms swing naturally front-to-back (not across your body). Hands relaxed.\n\n4. Engage your core, lean from the ankles\n\n* Lightly brace your belly; imagine a zipper closing from pelvis to ribs.\n* If you lean, let it be a tiny forward tilt from the ankles, not the waist.\n\n5. Foot placement under your body\n\n* Feet point forward, hip-width apart.\n* Step so your foot lands close to under your hips (avoid long overstrides).\n\n6. Heel-to-toe roll\n\n* Place the heel gently, roll through the midfoot, and push off the big toe.\n* Keep knees soft; don’t lock them.\n\n7. Short, quick steps (comfortable cadence)\n\n* Favor slightly shorter steps over long strides.\n* Aim for a smooth rhythm you can hold and talk through.\n\n8. Push-off & hip extension\n\n* As the back foot leaves the ground, squeeze glute lightly to extend the hip.\n* Let the trailing leg finish the stride behind you before it swings forward.\n\n9. Breathe easy\n\n* Inhale through the nose when you can; exhale fully.\n* Match breath to your rhythm (e.g., 3–4 steps inhale, 3–4 steps exhale).\n\n10. Periodic form check\n\n* Every few minutes: tall posture, relaxed jaw/shoulders, arms straight back-and-forth, feet pointing forward, smooth heel-to-toe roll.\n\nQuick don’ts: slouching, staring at your phone, overstriding, crossing arms across your midline, heavy stomping, and clenched fists.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also tailor these steps for hills, speed-walking, carrying a backpack, or treadmill use.\n",

For best results, try bending your knees to a 90-degree angle, then standing back up. [1] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 2. Keep your knees behind your toes. This protects your knees and back and helps you achieve maximum results. When you move into a squat, bend your knees so that they move directly over your feet, without going further than your toes. [3] X Expert Source Dean Theriot Personal Trainer Expert Interview 3. Keep your feet shoulder-width apart. For a standard free squat, start by keeping your feet under your shoulders. This help to avoid stress on your knees. 4. Angle your feet for plié squats. A plié squat is a free squat done with a wide stance. For these, it is important to angle your feet out and to bend your knees so they move directly over your feet. Begin by doing these at only a half-range of motion, and work up to getting your knee bends to 90 degrees. 5. Stop at the bottom. After you build up some leg strength, you may begin to \"break 90,\" or allow your squat to deepen more than a 90-degree bend in your knees. However, it is important to stop when your thighs lightly come into contact with your calves. Going beyond this can place unnecessary stress on your knees.",

If anything hurts (sharp pain), stop and adjust range or seek a pro.\n\n## 1) Set Your Stance\n\n* Feet about shoulder-width apart (a little wider or narrower based on comfort).\n* Toes turned slightly out (≈5–20°) so knees can track over them.\n* Distribute weight through the whole foot (heel + big toe + little toe). Look ahead.\n\n## 2) Brace\n\n* Take a deep breath “360°” into your belly and sides.\n* Gently lock ribs down as if prepping for a cough; keep spine neutral.\n* Set shoulders down/back. Lightly squeeze glutes.\n\n## 3) Initiate: Hips Back, Knees Out\n\n* Start the squat by sending the hips slightly back, then let the knees bend.\n* Let knees track in line with the toes (don’t cave inward).\n* Reach your arms forward a bit for balance if helpful.\n\n## 4) Descend Under Control\n\n* Lower smoothly; keep chest proud and back neutral.\n* Keep heels flat; stay balanced over mid-foot.\n* Go as low as **your** mobility allows—aim for thighs parallel to the floor or lower without losing your brace.\n\n## 5) Check the Bottom Position\n\n* Knees track over toes; don’t collapse inward.\n* Weight balanced (not on toes only; heels stay down).\n* Avoid excessive pelvis tuck (“butt wink”). If it appears, stop just above that range.\n\n## 6) Drive Up\n\n* Push the floor away through mid-foot/heels.\n* Stand up by extending hips and knees together (no shooting hips up first).\n* Keep knees tracking over toes; exhale through the sticking point.\n\n## 7) Finish Tall\n\n* Stand tall with hips and knees fully extended.\n* Reset your breath/bracing before the next rep.\n\n---\n\n## Breathing Cue (Simple)\n\n* **Inhale & brace** before you descend → **exhale** as you drive up.\n* For heavier sets, you can hold a gentle brace until you pass the hardest point, then exhale.\n\n## Common Mistakes → Quick Fixes\n\n* **Heels lift:** Widen stance slightly; slow down; work ankle mobility; try a small heel lift (5–10 mm).\n* **Knees cave in:** Think “spread the floor” or “push knees toward pinky toes.”\n* **Back rounds:** Re-brace; keep chest proud; shorten depth slightly; include core work.\n* **Leaning too far forward:** Bring heels under hips; use counterbalance arms; keep gaze forward.\n* **Bouncing/relaxing at bottom:** Pause briefly; keep tension.\n\n## Regressions (Easier)\n\n* **Box/Chair Squat:** Tap a box/chair behind you for depth control.\n* **Supported Squat:** Hold a doorframe/TRX for assistance.\n* **Heel-elevated Squat:** Place thin plates under heels to ease ankle demand.\n\n## Helpful Progressions (Harder)\n\n* **Goblet Squat (light weight)** for counterbalance and torso position.\n* **Tempo Squat:** 3-sec lower, no bounce, smooth up.\n* **Pause Squat:** 1–2 sec hold at the bottom with tension.\n* **Split Squat / Pistol to Box** for single-leg control.\n\n## Suggested Sets & Reps\n\n* Beginners: **3 × 8–10 reps**, rest 60–90 s.\n* Warm-up: 5 min light cardio + 2–3 easy ramp-up sets.\n\n> Goal: Smooth, controlled reps with consistent depth and balance.

    "prompt": "How to Bump a Volleyball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Get into position. You should stand with your legs about shoulder-width apart and should lean forward a bit. Your knees should be bent a little bit, ready to spring your legs into action. Your hands should come together in the last moment before the ball comes to you; when you approach the ball, you can keep your hands about half a foot apart, and bring them together when the ball comes toward you. Otherwise, it'll be hard to maneuver yourself to get in the right position to hit the ball. 2. Create a platform with your arms. The platform is the area between both your wrists and elbows which is the \"sweet spot\" for hitting the ball. To create your platform, the most important thing you need to do is to clasp your hands together correctly while holding your arms straight in front of you, slightly below your waist, with your shoulders arched. Clasp your hands in front of you, with your thumbs together, side-by-side. Don't lace your fingers together, for this will make you lose control of the ball. [2] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview You can either make a fist with one hand and wrap the other around it (the ball method), or you can bend one thumb down to its palm, and rest it on the other hand (the cup method), thus cupping it with the other hand. If you're using the cup method, then your thumbs should be parallel with each other, and your four fingers on each hand will be parallel with each other as well. Remember to keep your elbows locked and your knees bent. 3. Use your legs. Using your knees, and your arms, push through the ball. If you're a younger player (12 and under), you can benefit from bending your knees and using them to power your legs and get momentum to guide the ball. [4] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview 4. Hit the ball with both arms. Position yourself so that you hit the ball with both. Otherwise, you won't be able to aim the ball correctly and could be fouled. This can be a bit tricky, when the ball is coming at you at an unexpected angle, but it's always important to position yourself so that your ball hits your arms with equal force so you can aim and hit it correctly. [5] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview 5. Move to the ball so that it will come down squarely in front of you. You can bump the ball backwards, of course, but you still want to make sure that you make contact with the ball right in front of you (you may need to turn away from the net). You should face the direction the ball is coming with your shoulders and the front of your body for best results. If you don't need the ball to go back, swing your arms or bring them above your shoulders. If you do need it to go back, carefully swing your arms backward, as much as is needed. 6. Pass the ball. Keep your eye on the ball. Follow the trajectory of the ball as it comes down and even as you hit it. Make contact with the ball at about waist-level. When the ball is right above your forearms, straighten your legs so that your arms move up to meet it. Try to contact the ball on your forearms (above the hand but below the elbow joint.). At the same time, move your arms forward and up slightly, but do not swing your arms . Contrary to what a lot of people think, the majority of the force should come from your legs. 7. Aim the ball. Dip or twist your shoulder to aim the ball. You can't really aim with your forearms, because you need to keep them flat in order to provide a good platform for the ball. Instead move from the shoulders so that both arms stay together and move as one unit. Ideally, you can square up with the ball (point your feet at the target) so you can just hit it straight forward. Remember to aim the ball slightly to the right of the center of the net, since that is where the setter should be standing. You should drop the shoulder and put the weight on the ball that is moving towards the target. Use your platform to help you aim the ball. 8. Keep your eye on the ball after you bump it. Watch the ball with your eyes, not your whole body, try to keep your chin down, because it gives you more control of the ball. Some coaches will even have you put the collar of your shirt in your mouth to keep your chin down. Once you release the ball, separate your hands, but still keep them half a foot or so apart, anticipating the ball's next movement and get ready to hit the volleyball.",

Ready stance\n\n* Feet a little wider than shoulder-width, toes slightly out.\n* Knees bent, hips back, chest tall, weight on the balls of your feet.\n* Hands relaxed in front; eyes on the server.\n\n2. Build your platform\n\n* Join your hands: either **palm over fist** or **hands together with thumbs side-by-side**.\n* Straighten elbows so forearms are flat; thumbs parallel and pointed down.\n* Keep shoulders rounded forward to “lock” the platform.\n\n3. Move your feet first\n\n* Shuffle to get **behind** the ball.\n* Drop your hips—low, wide base. The ball should meet you **in front of your midline**.\n\n4. Contact\n\n* Let the ball strike the **forearms** (not wrists/hands).\n* Contact is low, between waist and hips.\n* Keep head still; eyes on the ball through contact.\n\n5. Angle and direct\n\n* Angle your platform toward the target (usually the setter).\n* Use shoulders to set the angle—don’t break your elbows.\n\n6. Lift with your legs (minimal arm swing)\n\n* Drive up slightly by extending knees and hips.\n* Arms stay straight; no big swing. Think “quiet arms, strong legs.”\n\n7. Hold the finish\n\n* Freeze your platform for a beat, facing the target.\n* Then recover to ready stance and communicate (“Mine!”, “Outside!”).\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid\n\n* Swinging arms like a pendulum.\n* Letting the ball hit your wrists.\n* Interlocking fingers or crossing thumbs unevenly.\n* Leaning backward at contact.\n\nWant a version tailored for kids’ practice or a printable drill sheet?

    "prompt": "How to Rotate in Volleyball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Know the six court positions. Each team's side of the volleyball court will be filled with two rows of three players each, making for a total of six spots. Though players rotate clockwise, the positions are labeled counter-clockwise. Here they are: Position 1: The right back, where the serving player is. Position 2: The right front, just in front of the right back. Position 3: The middle front, to the left of the front right. Position 4: The left front, which is to the left of the middle front. Position 5: The left-back, behind the left front. Position 6: The middle back, behind the middle front. 2. Know your position on the team. Your court position is where you are standing on the court, which changes with every rotation; your position on the team is your set role and does not change. Here are the six positions and what they do: The setter: The setter's job is to set up the hitters so that they could hit the ball. Ideally, the setter will get possession of the ball second to set it up for the hitters; if he/she can't get to it, then he/she has to yell \"help,\" and have someone else do it. If he/she accidentally gets it first, then he has to yell \"setter out\" so someone else can set it. The outside-hitter : This player hits the ball from the strong corner (front left for right-handed players; front right for left-handed players). The middle-blocker : This is usually a tall, strong person on the team, who is mostly in the middle front and blocks every hit. This player also moves to form a double block with either of the outside hitters. DS : This player plays in the back row and does a lot of rolling and digging so that they keep the ball in play. If they want to come in the game, they have to make a substitution with the refs. The libero : The libero, (a position created in 1998) only plays in the back row but can join the game as often as needed. They also wear a different jersey than the rest of the team. The libero is a good passer, a good digger, and has good ball-handling skills. This player often takes the place of the middle blocker when he or she rotates to the back row. Each position has a court position that is best for it. For example, middle blockers are best when they are playing in the middle front. Setters are best at right front, outside hitters are best at left front, and DS and libero can be anywhere in the back row, although libero is often best at middle back. 3. Know when to rotate. You rotate when you side out. A side-out is when the other team has the serve, but your team wins the point . In volleyball, you rotate clockwise. If your team wins the point when the other team is serving, then the person in the front right moves to the right back, becoming the new server. If your team is serving and you win a point, you do not rotate, but stay in the same position. After serving from position 1, a player will rotate to position 6 (middle back), then to position 5 (left back), then to position 4 (left front), then to position three (middle front), then to position two (right front), before returning to position 1, the serving position. Just remember that each player only rotates one time after the team gains possession of the serve; the next time each player rotates will be after the other team wins possession of the ball and loses the point. 4. Know when to sub out. Depending on your level of play and position, you may either stay in the game or be subbed out with another player when you reach a certain rotation. If you are a front row player (setter, outside hitter, or middle blocker), you may substitute with a back row player (DS or libero) when you get to right back, or you might be allowed to serve and then sub out. Back row players will sub with front row players when they reach the left front. 5. Know where to move during your rotations. You can move after the server makes contact with the ball to optimize your position. For example, if you're a setter who is in the left front, you can move to the right front after the server makes contact so you can be in the best location for your position. This is the same for other positions too. Middle blockers will always try to run to middle front, outside hitters will try to run to left front, and so on. Just remember that you cannot move until the ball is served. Players can move positions, but backcourt players can't move to the net to block or spike and must make all attacking actions behind the attack line. This rule is in play so skilled spikers can't dominate in all six of their court rotations. The setter can sometimes look like he's \"hiding\" behind the other players before a point; this is because he has to be in the correct rotation order before he can move to the net.",

It also notes the libero’s back-row restrictions.*\n\n# Text Steps (Indoor 6v6)\n\n1. Set your rotation order\n\n* Before the set, list players 1–6 in the serving order. This order never changes during the set.\n\n2. Know the six court spots\n\n* P1 = Right Back (RB, serving zone)\n* P2 = Right Front (RF)\n* P3 = Middle Front (MF)\n* P4 = Left Front (LF)\n* P5 = Left Back (LB)\n* P6 = Middle Back (MB)\n* The dashed 3 m/10 ft line is the attack line.\n\n3. Overlap rule at the moment of serve\n\n* Front-row players (2,3,4) must be closer to the net than their corresponding back-row players (1,6,5).\n* Left players (4 and 5) must be left of the centers on their row; right players (2 and 1) must be right of the centers.\n* Officials judge by players’ feet on the floor. Once the ball is **contacted** for serve, players may move anywhere.\n\n4. When to rotate\n\n* Rotate **only** when your team wins a rally while you were **receiving** (a side-out).\n* If you win a rally on **your** serve, do **not** rotate—keep serving.\n\n5. How to rotate (clockwise)\n\n* P2 → P1 (becomes the server)\n* P1 → P6\n* P6 → P5\n* P5 → P4\n* P4 → P3\n* P3 → P2\n\n6. After the serve\n\n* As soon as the server contacts the ball, players can “switch” into your team’s base system (e.g., 5–1 or 6–2).\n* The rotation order still matters for the **next** serve.\n\n7. Libero quick notes\n\n* Libero replaces a **back-row** player (often P5 or P6), never plays front row, can’t block or attack above the net in front of the attack line.\n* Depending on your league, the libero may be allowed to serve in one rotation.\n\n8. Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Rotating after your own point on serve (wrong).\n* Switching **before** the serve is contacted (overlap fault).\n* Back-row player attacking above the net in front of the attack line.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also make a version tailored to a 5–1 or 6–2 system with the setter’s specific movements.\n",

It is the movement of players on the court in a clockwise direction after a side-out (when the opposing team loses the serve). This ensures that all players get an opportunity to play in different positions, promoting fair play and strategic diversity.\n\n### Step 1: Starting Formation\n\nBefore the serve, players line up in a specific formation. This is typically a three-front, three-back alignment, with setters often starting in the back row. ### Step 2: Side-Out and Rotation\n\nWhen your team wins the serve after the opponent's serve, a \"side-out\" occurs. This is when your team earns the right to serve. At this point, players rotate one position clockwise. The player in the right-back position moves to the serving position. ### Step 3: New Positions\n\nAfter the rotation, each player will be in a new position. For example, the right-back player becomes the server, the middle-front player moves to the right-front, and so on. This rotation continues each time your team gets a side-out. ",

    "text_ref": "1. Set your body in the correct posture. To hit an overhand serve, you need to stand with your feet about shoulder width apart with the foot opposite your hitting hand slightly forward. You should have your hips squared off to the net. [1] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview Most of your weight should be on your back foot. 2. Toss the ball in front of your hitting arm. An overhand serve requires you to toss the ball with your less dominant arm so you can hit it with your dominant arm. This step takes lots of practice to be able to toss the ball in the best position to be hit. Toss the ball in front of your hitting arm and about two to four feet above your head. Being consistent with your toss is what will make you a good server, so be sure to practice this frequently. 3. Hit the ball with the upper part of your palm. Spread your fingers really wide and make contact with the ball with the palm of your hand. Contact the ball in the center and try to hit it when the ball is high enough to go straight over the net. [3] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview In an upperhand serve, the trajectory of the ball should be straight. Make sure to follow through after hitting the ball so that your arm is extended out straight towards the net. 4. Stand with your feet staggered. Having the correct posture when serving is an important step to take. When serving underhand, your feet should be staggered with the opposite foot of your hitting arm forward. This will give you a good solid base as you serve. Most of your body weight should be on your back foot. Your hips should be squared off with the net. 5. Position the ball in front of your hitting arm. Your hitting arm is the arm that will actually force the ball to go over the net, and it's usually your dominant arm. Use your other arm to hold the ball in front of your body to the side directly in front of your hitting arm. [4] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview 6. Make contact with the ball. To hit the ball, you can make a fist with your hand and try to make contact with the flat part of your fist where your thumb and pointer finger meet. Swing your arm like a pendulum, backwards first and then forwards to hit the ball. You should make contact with the ball slightly below the center to make the ball travel out and up over the net. [5] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview Keep your eye on the ball where you want to make contact. Transfer your weight from your back foot to your front foot as you hit the ball. Try to drop your holding hand right before hitting the ball. Let your hitting hand follow the ball as it is hit, making sure you follow through straight forward. [6] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview You can also hit the ball with the bottom of the palm of your hand.",

Ready stance\n\n* Feet a little wider than shoulder-width, slight stagger.\n* Knees bent, hips back, chest tall, weight on the balls of your feet.\n* Hands loose in front; eyes on the setter, then the hitter.\n\n2. Read & move\n\n* As the hitter approaches, start moving early to where the ball will go.\n* Use quick shuffle or crossover steps while staying low—don’t backpedal.\n\n3. Get behind the ball\n\n* Try to line your body up so the ball will meet you in the centerline of your body.\n* Plant your last two steps balanced and stable.\n\n4. Build your platform\n\n* Join wrists (thumbs parallel, wrists together), straighten elbows, and roll shoulders slightly inward to make a flat forearm surface.\n* Keep arms away from the body enough to stay flat—no bent elbows.\n\n5. Angle to target\n\n* Slightly tilt your platform toward your target (usually the middle front/near your setter).\n* Hips and shoulders should face where you want the ball to go.\n\n6. Contact on the forearms\n\n* Let the ball meet your platform between the wrists and elbows, in front of your body and between your knees and waist.\n* Keep your head steady and eyes through contact.\n\n7. Lift with the legs, not the arms\n\n* “Give” a few inches to absorb the hit, then extend with your legs to lift the ball.\n* Do not swing your arms—freeze your platform through contact.\n\n8. Create a playable arc\n\n* Send a high, controlled arc toward the target—think safe height and distance over perfection.\n* Hold your finish for a beat to ensure accuracy.\n\n9. Recover quickly\n\n* After contact, immediately drop back into your ready stance and track the next play (tip/roll or second swing).\n\n10. Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Swinging the arms, separating wrists, contacting on the biceps or hands.\n* Standing up tall at contact, platform facing the hitter instead of the target.\n* Reaching with one arm when you could move your feet to center the ball.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor these to your level (beginner, libero, beach vs. indoor) or add drills to practice each step.\n",

Keep your eyes on the ball at all times. This is crucial for proper timing. \n3.  **Platform Formation (for Bumping):** If you're going to bump, join your hands together to form a flat platform with your forearms. Keep your elbows locked and your arms straight. Do not swing your arms; use your legs to drive through the ball. \n4.  **Arm Swing (for Spiking/Serving):** For an overhead hit (spike or serve), bring your hitting arm back, elbow high. Your non-hitting arm can point towards the ball for balance and targeting. \n5.  **Contact Point:** Hit the ball with the heel of your hand or your forearm, depending on the type of hit. For an overhead hit, contact the ball at its highest point in front of you. For a bump, contact it on your forearms. \n6.  **Follow Through:** After contact, continue your arm swing in the direction you want the ball to go. This ensures power and accuracy. \n",

    "prompt": "How to Dig a Volleyball? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Study the opposing hitter(s). Watch him/her in warmups before the game even starts, if you can. Watch his/her hitting motion on spikes and take note of any tendencies that might give you a split-second advantage in knowing where a spike is headed. Keep an eye out for “tells.” Does he strongly favour spiking to his left? Does she exaggerate her backswing when faking a spike? 2. Watch the hitter’s motion as you prepare to dig. Even deceptive spikers tend to align their shoulders in the direction they intend to hit. Take an educated guess on where the ball is headed, but also don’t assume it has to go there. (Lean a bit that way, don’t “sell out.”) 3. Always expect the ball to come to you. Even if your read on the hitter says you’re in the clear, be prepared to be wrong and to react. Good misdirection spikers are betting on you relaxing. 4. Be light on your feet. This applies generally to volleyball positioning, but especially for digging. Keep your weight forward on your toes so you can move more quickly. There’s a reason why the phrase “on your heels” has a negative connotation. 5. Get low and lean forward. Get into a low \"ready\" position, even lower than you would to receive a serve. It is easier to rise for a high ball than to dip lower for a low one. Keep your knees bent and bend at the waist so that your shoulders are out past your knees. Place your feet wider than your shoulders. Hold your arms out away from your body. [3] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview Keep your weight balanced on your toes so you can spring forward or to either side to get the ball. 6. Place your arms in a receiving position. When the spike is imminent, stretch your arms, pressed together from hands to elbows, in front of you. Bend and lock elbows. [4] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview You are creating a “platform” from wrists to elbows upon which the ball will bounce. You’re not a carpenter but a volleyball player, so don’t make it a level platform unless you want the ball to bounce back over your head (or off your forehead). Keep your wrists lower than your elbows to direct the ball forward. To hold your hands together, place your thumbs side by side and overlap the fingers of your stronger hand over the curled fingers of your weaker hand. 7. Move to meet the ball. Remember your footwork, and don’t lunge unless you have to. Otherwise, take a quick step or a shuffle and remain in your ready position. Keep low as you relocate. 8. Aim for your target. Your goal on a dig is not just to get the ball up in the air, but to pass it to a teammate to set up your offensive series. [7] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview You’ll most likely be aiming for your setter up by the net. Align your body as much as possible towards that target while receiving the spike. Use all that geometry you learned in school to set your platform at the right angle. Aim a little short of your target if necessary to keep from digging the ball back over the net. Don’t give your opponents an easy second chance. 9. Absorb and redirect the spike. You don’t need to swing at the ball; the spiker has supplied all the necessary power (and then some, most likely) for your purposes. Keep your elbows locked and your angle of deflection the same, but let your shoulders dip to absorb some of the power of the shot. Even though you aren’t swinging at the ball, do follow through with your platform, moving your arms slightly upward and towards your target. Think of it as nudging the ball in the right direction. 10. Dive and dig. A good spiker won’t always give you the luxury of properly setting your feet and platform to direct the ball cleanly to your teammate. Sometimes, you’re just going to have to hit the floor (or the sand). To dive for a spike in front of you, bend your knees to get even lower and drive your body forward. Your platform and upper body will be parallel and close to the ground. Slide on your chest as you hit the ball, ideally on your platform but even with your wrist or knuckles. When you need to stretch out as far as possible, you can try a “pancake.” Extend your hands, palms down, while you dive so that the ball bounces off the back of your hand(s). Slide on your palms along with your upper body. Keep your head up as you dive. Do this not only so you can see the ball but also so you don’t smack your chin on the ground as you land. 11. Sprawl and dig. Similar to a dive, a sprawl is directed more toward one side or the other. If the ball is to your right or left, step out in that direction and extend outward as in a dive. Dip your inside shoulder (the side away from the ball) while keeping your arms together. This will allow you to maintain the angle of your platform in the intended direction. Bend your elbows more or curl your wrists if necessary to keep them off the floor as you stretch and to maintain at least part of your platform at the correct angle. 12. Get the ball in the air. Proper technique is fantastic and will make you a better and more consistent digger, but in the end, your essential job is to get the ball back up in the air. (They don’t award points for good technique as the ball bounces past you.) Especially on partial blocks or deflections that send the ball on an unexpected trajectory, you may have to lurch your body, flail your arms, and land a little less gracefully. Do what you have to. Unless you’re in the Olympics or something like that, don’t risk injury just to dig a spike, though. Landing awkwardly can cause leg, arm, or even head injuries. Proper equipment, such as knee pads and ankle wraps, will help quite a bit.",

Ready stance\n\n* Feet a little wider than shoulder-width, slight stagger.\n* Knees bent, hips back, chest tall, weight on the balls of your feet.\n* Hands loose in front; eyes on the setter, then the hitter.\n\n2. Read & move\n\n* As the hitter approaches, start moving early to where the ball will go.\n* Use quick shuffle or crossover steps while staying low—don’t backpedal.\n\n3. Get behind the ball\n\n* Try to line your body up so the ball will meet you in the centerline of your body.\n* Plant your last two steps balanced and stable.\n\n4. Build your platform\n\n* Join wrists (thumbs parallel, wrists together), straighten elbows, and roll shoulders slightly inward to make a flat forearm surface.\n* Keep arms away from the body enough to stay flat—no bent elbows.\n\n5. Angle to target\n\n* Slightly tilt your platform toward your target (usually the middle front/near your setter).\n* Hips and shoulders should face where you want the ball to go.\n\n6. Contact on the forearms\n\n* Let the ball meet your platform between the wrists and elbows, in front of your body and between your knees and waist.\n* Keep your head steady and eyes through contact.\n\n7. Lift with the legs, not the arms\n\n* “Give” a few inches to absorb the hit, then extend with your legs to lift the ball.\n* Do not swing your arms—freeze your platform through contact.\n\n8. Create a playable arc\n\n* Send a high, controlled arc toward the target—think safe height and distance over perfection.\n* Hold your finish for a beat to ensure accuracy.\n\n9. Recover quickly\n\n* After contact, immediately drop back into your ready stance and track the next play (tip/roll or second swing).\n\n10. Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* Swinging the arms, separating wrists, contacting on the biceps or hands.\n* Standing up tall at contact, platform facing the hitter instead of the target.\n* Reaching with one arm when you could move your feet to center the ball.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor these to your level (beginner, libero, beach vs. indoor) or add drills to practice each step.",

Your knees should be bent, feet shoulder-width apart, and weight slightly forward on the balls of your feet. Keep your arms relaxed in front of you. This allows you to react quickly to the ball.\n\n\n### Step 2: Move to the Ball\nAs the ball comes towards you, move your feet to get directly behind it. Avoid reaching with just your arms; use small, quick steps to adjust your body position. Your goal is to get your platform (forearms) under the ball.\n\n\n### Step 3: Form Your Platform\nJoin your hands together to create a flat, solid platform with your forearms. One hand should be on top of the other, with thumbs together and pointing down. Lock your elbows to keep your arms straight and firm. This platform is what you'll use to make contact with the ball.\n\n\n### Step 4: Contact the Ball\nMake contact with the ball on your forearms, just above your wrists. As you make contact, slightly shrug your shoulders and angle your platform towards your target (usually the setter). Use your legs to drive up and forward, absorbing the force of the hit. Avoid swinging your arms.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Hold a Ping Pong Paddle? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Fit the blade of the paddle in the space between your thumb and index finger. If you look at your hand you’ll see the “V” shape that your thumb and index finger form. Place the paddle in your hand and move it so that its inside right bottom edge rests in that “V”. 2. Wrap your middle, ring, and pinky fingers around the handle. These are the only fingers you use to hold the ping paddle handle with a shakehand grip. These fingers should look similar to how they look when you’re shaking someone’s hand. Try moving the paddle up and down in a hand-shaking motion to the feel for this grip. 3. Rest your index finger against the outside of the paddle. Again, think of shaking someone’s hand. Your index finger is usually pointed outwards instead of curled in. This will help stabilize the paddle when you swing. If it feels more comfortable, let the tip of your finger rest against the side edge. 4. Curl your thumb around the front of the handle if you want greater wrist flexibility. This is called a shallow shakehand grip, and it's probably the most natural grip for beginners. It’s great for high freedom of movement for the paddle, which will make returning the ball easier. While this grip is usually pretty natural feeling, if it doesn't feel right to you, that may be a sign to try something else. 5. Rest your thumb against the front face of the paddle if you want a firmer grip. While this deep shakehand grip limits wrist flexibility, it works well for precise shots that don’t need a lot of power. Holding your paddle this way will also make it easy to switch the paddle from side to side, so it's great for both forehand and backhand shots. You can always switch between this thumb position and wrapping your thumb around the handle to get the benefits of both! 6. Keep your grip loose. Of course you want to grip the paddle firmly enough so it doesn’t fly out of your hand when you play, but a person should still be able to grab the paddle from you with only slight resistance. A too-tight grip will limit wrist flexibility too much making it difficult to hit or spin the ball. The paddle should feel like a natural extension of your arm, moving as freely as you move your hand. 7. Hold the paddle so its edge is perpendicular to the ground. You’ll notice your wrist tilts slightly downward. While the angle of the paddle will shift as you play, you want your wrist to stay in this position. Avoid floppy wrists when you swing! This will lead to you mis-hitting the ball. You need your entire forearm to swing and if you move your wrists around too much they’ll get tired. 8. Rest the handle in the space between your thumb and index finger. See the “V” shape formed by your thumb and index finger. With the handle angled upwards, rest its edge inside that “V” the way you would a pen. 9. Grip the handle between your thumb and index finger. Form a loop around the handle. Imagine writing with the paddle like a pen or pencil, and try moving it around in a pen writing motion to get a feel for the grip. 10. Keep your remaining fingers relaxed if you want greater wrist flexibility. For the Chinese penhold grip, lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with the tips of your middle, ring, and pinky fingers. Keep your fingers in a relaxed position. Holding the paddle this way will give you a wide range of motion and make it easy to block and push the ball. This grip makes it hard to consistently use backhand topspin or the spinning of the ball using the outside part of the paddle. 11. Straighten your middle, ring, and pinky fingers for more powerful strokes. For the Korean/Japanese penhold grip, the edge of your middle finger should lightly grip the outside face of the paddle with your ring and pinky stacked on top of it. You want your fingers to be rigidly straight. Holding the paddle this way will let you easily return a ball when standing far away from the table. Straight fingers can restrict paddle blade movement, making it harder for you to switch the paddle angle to reach the ball. 12. Use the “V” grip for high power and ball spin. Hold the blade of the paddle between your index and middle finger, forming a “V” shape. Place your thumb where it feels most comfortable. This grip ideal for wide-angle shots. Keep in mind that isn’t as popular as the penhold or shakehand grip, so finding a coach that specializes in it can be hard. 13. Block effectively with the Seemiller grip. Wrap your fingers around the handle of the paddle and rest your index finger on its back face as close to the bottom edge as you can get it. Use your thumb to grip the paddle blade with your index finger from the other side. Since backhand wrist flexibility is limited for this style, you may want to make backhand shots using the forehand side of your paddle. 14. Achieve heavy topspin with the reverse penhold grip. Hold the paddle handle between your thumb and index finger and rest your remaining three fingers against the paddle's outside face, keeping them relaxed. Angle the paddle in your hand slightly up so you can use both sides of the paddle to hit the ball. This grip is very similar to other penhold grips. The difference comes down to the angle you hold paddle and your style of play, and it's not unusual to see this grip combined with the Chinese or Korean/Japanese penhold styles.",

    "GPT_text": "Here are your step-by-step **text instructions** (the visual is provided separately above).\n\n# Shakehand grip (most common)\n\n1. Start neutral\n   Hold the handle like a handshake. Keep your wrist relaxed and the blade (paddle face) roughly vertical.\n\n2. Thumb & index placement\n   Rest your **thumb lightly on the forehand rubber** near the handle. Lay your **index finger across the backhand rubber**, roughly horizontal. They should form a soft “V” along the top of the handle bevel.\n\n3. Wrap the other fingers\n   Curl the remaining three fingers around the handle. Leave a small gap (about a fingertip) between your palm and the handle’s butt—no choking up, no palming the blade.\n\n4. Set pressure points\n   Apply gentle pressure mainly with **thumb and index**. Keep the other fingers loose so the wrist can move freely.\n\n5. Angle for strokes\n   For **forehands**, let the index side relax so the blade can close slightly. For **backhands**, add a touch more pressure with the thumb to open the blade. Adjust in millimeters, not inches.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   Blade makes ~90° with your forearm at rest; wrist feels free; you can wiggle the blade without it slipping.\n\n# Penhold grip (popular in East Asia)\n\n1. Pinch the neck\n   Pinch the front of the blade with **thumb and index** as if holding a pen. The “circle” they form sits just above the handle.\n\n2. Rear-finger support\n   Place the **other three fingers on the back** of the blade. Beginners usually “fan” them; some players “stack” the middle/ring fingers—both are fine.\n\n3. Keep space and softness\n   Leave space between palm and handle. Grip softly so the wrist is very mobile.\n\n4. Forehand feel\n   Most control comes from the thumb–index pinch. Keep the blade slightly closed for drives; open a touch for topspin.\n\n5. Backhand options\n   For traditional penhold, use the forehand side for many shots by rotating the wrist. For RPB (reverse penhold backhand), contact with the back side—keep those rear fingers relaxed to allow the flip.\n\n6. Quick checks\n   No squeezing; blade moves easily with wrist; contact points feel precise at the thumb/index.\n\n# Common mistakes to avoid\n\n* **Death grip** (too tight) → kills wrist speed and touch.\n* **Index finger too high** across the rubber → limits forehand.\n* **Thumb creeping up** onto the rubber → blocks backhand.\n* **Palming the blade** (covering rubber with the palm) → reduces spin and reach.\n\n# Fast reminders\n\n* Relax first, then add just enough firmness at contact.\n* Small pressure shifts (thumb ↔ index) fine-tune forehand/backhand angles.\n* Start with shakehand if you’re unsure; it’s the most versatile for beginners.\n\nIf you want, I can also generate a second image focused solely on **shakehand** or **penhold**, or make printable cue cards.\n",

Let's break them down.\n\n### Shakehand Grip\n\nThe Shakehand Grip is the most common grip and is similar to how you would shake someone's hand.\n\n**Step 1: Position Your Hand**\nHold the paddle face down, as if you're about to shake hands with it. Your index finger should be extended along the bottom edge of the rubber.\n\n\n**Step 2: Wrap Your Fingers**\nWrap your remaining three fingers (middle, ring, and pinky) around the handle. Your thumb should rest comfortably on the blade near your index finger, or slightly curled around the handle.\n\n\n**Step 3: Adjust for Comfort and Control**\nEnsure a firm but relaxed grip. You should be able to comfortably move your wrist and fingers for various shots. The V-shape formed by your thumb and index finger should be roughly centered on the handle.\n### Penhold Grip\n\nThe Penhold Grip is less common among beginners but is favored by some advanced players, especially from Asian countries. It's held much like you would hold a pen.\n\n**Step 1: Hold the Handle Like a Pen**\nHold the paddle with the blade pointing downwards. Your thumb and index finger should curl around the handle, holding it as if you're writing. The paddle head will be facing up.\n\n\n**Step 2: Position Your Remaining Fingers**\nYour middle, ring, and pinky fingers should rest on the back of the paddle blade, providing support and leverage. There are variations where these fingers are more extended or more curled.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Pallof Press? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Choose the right band for you. Resistance bands are usually labeled with a measure of how strong they are. For instance, a resistance band labeled as “light” will provide less resistance than one labeled “medium.” An appropriate band will leave you feeling winded after one to three sets of Pallof presses. If you’re unsure which band is right for you, begin doing Pallof presses with the lightest band available. Use progressively heavier bands as you gain strength and endurance. Resistance bands are usually sold in packs containing bands of varying levels of resistance. 2. Position the band on a piece of immobile exercise equipment or a vertical bar. The easiest way to secure the band is by wrapping one looped end around the bar (or piece of equipment), then pulling it through the other looped end. The band should be tied at a height parallel to the middle of your ribs. 3. Stand with your shoulders back and down, glutes tightened, and rib cage over your pelvis. Stand about one meter (one yard) from the point where the resistance band is secured. Position your feet in line with your hip bones, with about 12 inches (30 cm) between them. Stay conscious of your shoulders as you perform the Pallof press. Resist the temptation to bring your shoulders up in order to gain more power during your Pallof press. If your feet are too far apart, you’ll end up using your legs (rather than your core) to balance yourself. 4. Grab the resistance band and turn to the side. Once you’ve affixed the resistance band to an immobile object, turn 90 degrees away from it and pull the hanging end of the band toward the front and center of your body. For instance, if you turn 90 degrees to the left after attaching the resistance band, you’ll then need to grab the band with your right hand and pull it to a point just below your sternum. Once the end of the band is centered just below your sternum, grip the band with both hands. You can either lay one hand over the other, or interlock your fingers. 5. Push the resistance band directly out in front of you. Resist the motion to turn toward the point where the band is attached. After extending your arms as far as they can go, hold the position for a second. 6. Slowly bring your arms back in. Stop bringing your arms back when your elbows touch your sides. Your hands and forearms should not touch your sides. Your hands, still gripping the resistance band, should return to their starting position. 7. Alternate your left and right side. Perform 6-10 Pallof presses facing in one direction, then release the resistance band. Turn to the other side and perform an additional 6-10 more Pallof presses. This will complete one set. Perform one or two more sets of Pallof presses if you’re not winded by the end of your first set. The precise number of Pallof presses you perform is up to you. 8. Add sets to the routine. As your core grows stronger, your endurance will increase. For instance, instead of just performing one to three sets of Pallof presses, you might do three to four sets. After you gain even more endurance, you could perform four to five sets. Add more sets after you can execute one to three sets of Pallof presses without being fatigued. 9. Increase the resistance level. There are two ways to increase resistance when doing Pallof presses. You could use a stronger band. Alternately, you could take another step away from the point where the band is secured. Increasing resistance will help you develop core stability. 10. Use a cable machine. If you have access to a cable machine with height-adjustable cables, you can use it to perform a Pallof press. Simply adjust one cable to a height parallel with the middle of your rib-cage, then perform a standard Pallof press in the same way that you would with a regular resistance band. Using a cable machine offers the added convenience of being able to change the level of resistance quite easily by adjusting the weight. Don’t add so much weight that your knees start bending or your arms and shoulders start turning toward the cable machine. If you’re not sure how much weight you should be using, start off with five pounds (2.27 kilos) and add weight in small increments until you find a level of resistance that you’re comfortable pressing. Add more weight as you become stronger. You’ll know you’re getting stronger because you will feel less fatigued after performing a Pallof press. 11. Do a head-on Pallof press. Secure the resistance band to the base of a stationary piece of equipment, or slide the handle of a height-adjustable cable machine down to its lowest position. Face the cable machine or the object that the resistance band is attached to. Pull the end of the band (or the handle of the cable machine) up to a position just below your chin. Your elbows should be pointed down and touching your belly. When extending your arms, keep your hands at the same height they started from. After you extend your arms as far as possible, hold the position for half a second, then bring your hands back to the starting position. This variation is less about building stability and more about strengthening your abs. 12. Try a kneeling Pallof press to overhead. Kneel beside the object you secure your resistance band to, and secure the band at a point parallel to the middle of your ribs. Then, with your knees on a soft training mat, perform a standard Pallof press by extending your arms. Begin moving your hands in an arc by pointing them up at a 45-degree angle. Continue moving your hands up and back until they are directly over your head. Next, lower your hands so that they are again extended directly out in front of you, then return to the starting position. Pause for half a second between each motion. Pallof pressing from a kneeling position will improve your balance, strength, and mobility. The overhead motion is great for working your shoulders and arms. 13. Try a split stance Pallof press. In a split stance Pallof press, one leg is extended out behind you and bent slightly at the knee. Your front leg should also be bent slightly. After adopting this stance, perform the standard Pallof press. This variation will help you improve your balance and leg strength. 14. Do a Pallof press up-down. Perform a standard Pallof press, but after extending your arms to their maximum in front of you, lower one leg, then the other into a kneeling position. While still holding the resistance band in front of you, pull one leg in front of you and push off the ground to stand back up. Return your hands to the center of your chest. This Pallof press variation will help you not only improve your balance, but also coordination, leg and abdominal muscles.",

Setup\n\n* Anchor a cable or resistance band at chest height.\n* Stand sideways to the anchor, feet shoulder-width, knees soft.\n* Hold the handle/band with both hands at your sternum, elbows tucked. Step out until there’s steady sideways tension.\n\n2. Brace\n\n* Stack ribs over pelvis; think “tall through the crown of the head.”\n* Squeeze glutes lightly, exhale, and “zip up” your abs (as if bracing before a cough). Keep shoulders down and away from ears.\n\n3. Press Out\n\n* Without turning your torso, slowly press your hands straight out from the sternum until elbows are nearly straight.\n* The band will try to twist you toward the anchor—resist it. Hips and chest stay square.\n\n4. Hold\n\n* Pause for 1–2 seconds with arms extended. Maintain even weight on both feet and a neutral spine. Keep breathing—short nasal inhales, long controlled exhales.\n\n5. Return\n\n* Draw the hands back to your sternum under control. Do not let the band yank you or rotate your torso.\n\n6. Repeat & Switch Sides\n\n* Perform 6–12 controlled reps per side, 2–4 sets. Rest 45–75 seconds, then face the opposite direction and repeat.\n\n---\n\n### Form Cues\n\n* Imagine your belly button is a headlight pointing straight ahead—don’t let it “shine” toward the anchor.\n* Think “ribs down, glutes on.”\n* Move only at the shoulders and elbows; the trunk stays quiet.\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n* Rotating or leaning toward/away from the anchor during the press.\n* Letting the low back arch or the ribs flare up.\n* Locking the knees or shrugging the shoulders.\n* Using momentum—keep it smooth and controlled both ways.\n\n### Variations\n\n* **Tall-kneeling or half-kneeling Pallof Press:** lowers your base of support to challenge the core without loading the low back.\n* **Anti-rotation hold (iso):** press out and hold for 10–30 seconds.\n* **Overhead Pallof Press:** press up instead of straight out (lighter resistance).\n\n---\n\n**Visual Steps**\nI’ve generated a clean, step-by-step infographic showing the movement (setup → brace → press → hold → return → variation). If you want a different style (photo-realistic, different angles, or a band vs. cable version), tell me and I’ll make another.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Use the military press to work out your shoulders and upper arms. The basic exercise is simple. You start with the barbell resting on your collarbone, around shoulder height. You then lift the weight up until your arms are almost fully extended straight up. Finish one rep by lowering the weight back down to your collarbone. Those with low-back problems should focus on seated military presses. 2. Choose a barbell that you can comfortably lift to shoulder height to start with. Don't start a new exercise with the hardest weight you can muster. Begin instead with a barbell (the long rod with weights on either end), that you can comfortably pick up and put down. Anywhere from 30-50lbs is likely a good place to start, depending on your strength. 3. Set the barbell on a rack at roughly shoulder height. You do not start most military presses from the ground, but rather from a weight already lifted in the air. Set the barbell on the rack with the weights attached. You can also have a partner hand you the bar. In general, you'll be using the squat racks to position the barbell. You can lift the weight from the ground, but make sure you keep your spine straight and bend from your knees to pick it up. 4. Grip the bar slightly wider than shoulder width, with your palms facing forward and up. Once you have it, remove it from the rack and take a step back. The weight should be resting on your collar bone, with your chin tilted slightly up to make room. 5. Set your feet shoulder-width apart. Slightly bend your knees so that they aren't over extended. You want to be comfortable and on balance. Some people stagger their feet (one head, one behind) for better balance. 6. Exhale as you push the bar straight above your head. Extend your arms up simultaneously until they are straight. The bar will be above you and slightly in front of your head. Hold this position for a half second -- this is your starting pose. Make sure you engage your core muscles as you do the exercise. [4] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Fitness Coach Expert Interview Squeeze your glutes as you push up to help protect your back. [5] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Fitness Coach Expert Interview 7. Inhale as you lower the bar back to your collar bone. Keep your feet still and your movements slow and regular. Your spine should not move and your back must be straight. If you're struggling to keep your back straight, you have too much weight. Your elbows should form a 90-degree angle. A \"flat back\" is essential to prevent injury. Do not push yourself if you can't hold proper form -- you won't get stronger, you'll just get hurt. [7] X Expert Source Danny Gordon Certified Fitness Coach Expert Interview 8. Push the bar back up to finish one rep. As you exhale, slowly and evenly push the bar back into the air. This is one rep. Rest for 1-2 seconds at the top, then lower the bar and repeat for your chosen number of reps. In general, you want to do enough reps so that the last 2-3 are tough, but still doable. Try and do three even sets.",

Unrack\n\n* Big breath and brace.\n* Lift the bar out by pushing up with your legs locked (no dip) and take 1–2 small steps back to your press area.\n\n3. Start Position\n\n* Bar lightly touches upper chest/clavicles.\n* Elbows slightly in front of the bar; lats engaged; eyes forward.\n\n4. Press Path (the first inches)\n\n* Pull your chin slightly back to clear the path.\n* Drive the bar **straight up** close to your face; think “push the bar, move the head back.”\n\n5. Mid-Press\n\n* As the bar passes your forehead, push your head “through the window” so it finishes over your mid-foot.\n* Keep glutes tight and abs braced to prevent lower-back arching.\n\n6. Lockout\n\n* Arms straight (not hyperextended); bar stacked over shoulders, hips, and mid-foot.\n* Shrug slightly at the top to finish with active shoulders. Brief pause.\n\n7. Lowering\n\n* Inhale, keep the brace, and **pull** the bar down along the same vertical line, staying close to the face.\n* Return it with control to the upper chest/clavicles.\n\n8. Repeat & Breathe\n\n* Use a breath/brace for each rep: inhale and brace before the press, exhale at lockout or after the bar returns to the chest.\n* Typical strength sets: 3–5 sets of 3–8 reps with 2–3 min rest.\n\nQuick cues\n\n* “Knuckles up, wrists straight.”\n* “Squeeze glutes, ribs down.”\n* “Bar straight up; head back, then through.”\n\nCommon mistakes to avoid\n\n* Overarching the low back (keep the brace; squeeze glutes).\n* Letting the bar drift forward (stay vertical over mid-foot).\n* Bent-back wrists or elbows flaring straight out.\n* Rushing the unrack or taking big steps back.\n\nSafety & variations\n\n* Warm up shoulders and T-spine first.\n* If shoulders are cranky, try a **dumbbell press**, **seated press**, or a **slight-wider grip** within comfort.\n* Stop if you feel sharp pain or numbness; consult a qualified coach or clinician if unsure.\n",

Your elbows should be pointing slightly forward. Ensure your core is braced and your back is straight.\n\n**Step 2: The Press**\nInitiate the movement by pressing the barbell straight overhead. As the bar moves past your head, slightly push your head and torso forward. Continue to press until your arms are fully extended and the barbell is directly over your head.\n\n**Step 3: Overhead Position**\nAt the top of the movement, your arms should be fully locked out, and the barbell should be in line with your ears, directly above your shoulders and hips. Your core should still be tight, and your body should form a straight line.\n\n**Step 4: Controlled Descent**\nSlowly lower the barbell back to the starting position at your upper chest, maintaining control throughout the movement.

    "text_ref": "1. Inhale before you begin. [2] X Expert Source Katie Prendergast Certified Personal Trainer & Nutrition Coach Expert Interview After you’ve warmed up, done some deep breathing exercises, and are in proper form, take in your initial breath right before you unrack the bar. [3] X Expert Source Katie Prendergast Certified Personal Trainer & Nutrition Coach Expert Interview Alternatively, you may breathe while your arms are descending, but keep in mind your body might lose its tightness. As you breathe, your trunk, which is comprised of your chest, belly, lower back and sides, should inflate like a balloon, expanding outwards. Your chest will expand towards the ceiling. Make sure your form is correct. You should be laying flat on the bench, eyes looking straight up at the bar. Your chest should push out and your shoulder-blades should be squeezed together. Your feet should remain flat on the floor. There should be a moderate or neutral gap between your hands. Hold the bar with a full grip (in your palms) and straight wrists. If necessary, chalk your hands. 2. Hold your breath as you lower the bar. As you lower the bar towards your chest, keep holding your breath even as you reach your sticking point. This is the point where the weight feels heaviest and is usually right above your chest. As you lower the bar, keep your shoulder-blades squeezed, elbows in and chest up and out. While you bring the bar down, your elbows will want to expand to a 90 degree angle. Keep your lats (back muscles) tight and your elbows in, at about a 45-75 degree angle from your body. If you take a breath when the weight has reached the bottom, you will loose stability in your torso. 3. Try exhaling gradually if you are a beginner. Right before the bar hits your chest, begin to press up. As you push the bar up, gathering strength from your back muscles, exhale slowly through pursed lips until you’ve reached the top. Keep your throat constricted to maintain some air in your lungs. Once you've reached the top, lock your elbow joints (lockout), and replace the bar on the rack. The gradual exhalation will assist and fuel your muscles as they push the weights up. 4. Breathe out at the end if you are more advanced. [9] X Expert Source Katie Prendergast Certified Personal Trainer & Nutrition Coach Expert Interview If you have more experience, exhale at the top of your press, after you have locked your elbows and move the bar over your shoulders. Some bench-pressers often do multiple reps in the same breath. 5. Warm-up before you begin. [10] X Expert Source Katie Prendergast Certified Personal Trainer & Nutrition Coach Expert Interview Warming up is essential to increasing blood flow and your core temperature, allowing for better breathing and stronger form. A simple warm up routine involves deep breathing exercises and doing practice reps with lighter weights. For a more complicated warm up, try ramp-up sets, which involves increasing your weight load as you decrease your repetitions. This will best prepare your muscles to bench-press your goal weight. 6. Keep your form throughout. As you breathe, and throughout the exercise, your shoulders and elbows will likely want to drift upwards and outwards. Remember, keep your eyes on the ceiling, your shoulder-blades tight, and elbows tucked in. Your feet should remain grounded on the floor. Your shoulders might want to lift as if you were breathing while standing up. It is important that they stay tight and pressed to the seat. By keeping your shoulder-blades tucked in, your shoulders will remain stable. 7. Breathe correctly--into your chest, not your belly. In 360 degree breathing, you should feel your ribcage expand as you breathe, and not just your stomach. [12] X Expert Source Katie Prendergast Certified Personal Trainer & Nutrition Coach Expert Interview How you breathe will affect your core control. 8. Don't forget to breathe. Many skilled bench-pressers do many reps in the same breath. If you are a beginner, don't force yourself to do the same. Taking an initial breath will provide the necessary stamina to fuel your press, but it will take careful training to build up your resistance.",

    "Gemini_text": "Breathing correctly during a bench press is crucial for stability, strength, and safety. Here's a breakdown of how to do it, with visual aids:\n\n**Step 1: The Setup Breath**\nBefore you even unrack the bar, take a deep, diaphragmatic breath. This means breathing into your belly, not just your chest. This initial breath helps brace your core and set your body for stability. **Step 2: Inhale as You Lower (Eccentric Phase)**\nAs you begin to lower the bar towards your chest, slowly inhale. Continue to fill your belly with air. This sustained breath further increases intra-abdominal pressure, creating a solid foundation for your lift. **Step 3: Hold Your Breath and Brace (Bottom of the Movement)**\nOnce the bar touches your chest (or reaches its lowest point in your range of motion), hold your breath. This is where the Valsalva maneuver comes into play. By holding your breath and contracting your abdominal muscles, you create a rigid core, which is essential for transferring force efficiently and protecting your spine.**Step 4: Exhale as You Press Up (Concentric Phase)**\nAs you initiate the upward press, slowly begin to exhale. The exhale should be controlled and powerful, synchronized with the effort of pushing the weight back up. Don't \"dump\" all your air at once; a controlled exhale helps maintain some intra-abdominal pressure throughout the lift. ",

If your doorway does not have a door, or you choose to remove your door, you have a choice as to which side you will face. If your door remains in the doorway, you’ll have to install your bar so that you hang on the opposite side from where the door is when it’s open. You will not be able to close the door while a doorway pull-up bar is in place. Either install your bar in a doorway that doesn’t need a closed door, or remove your pull-up bar after each use by not using the hardware to permanently attach it.

Rest the rear horizontal piece above your door frame on the other side. If you look at your pull-up bar, it has a flat piece that’s narrower than the rest of the parts of the bar. It may have a piece of foam or rubber on it. Raise this piece up and through the door, so that it’s resting on top of the door frame on the opposite side from where you’ll be hanging. Make sure the horizontal piece rests smoothly and flat on top of the door frame. If it’s crooked at all, the bar will not be safe to use. 3. Center the bar so rubber is touching both sides of your door frame. You want your bar to be centered so that the parts touching the sides of your door frame are rubber. If it’s off-center, metal parts may touch your door frame and you risk putting a dent in the frame. 4. Screw mounting brackets in if you want a permanent bar. Some doorway bars come with mounting brackets to keep the bar permanently in place. To install them, lift on the rear horizontal piece to remove it, and use a power drill to install the brackets about 13.75 inches (34.9 cm) apart above your door frame where the horizontal piece was. Consult the instruction guide of your pull-up bar model to determine exactly how far apart to install the mounting brackets. Mounting brackets for doorway pull-up bars are optional, since your body weight is on the opposite side of the rear horizontal piece which acts as a lever to hold the bar in place while you use it. You must actually lift up on the back of the bar to get it to come down. 5. Test the bar to be sure it’s sturdy. Without using your full body weight, pull down on the bar a couple of times to make sure it doesn’t move. If the bar is centered and level with the door frame in the back, it should be sturdy enough to hold all your weight. Next, try hanging on it without doing a pull-up to see if it holds all your weight. If the bar holds your hanging weight without moving, you’re ready to start working out and doing pull-ups on it. Check the instruction guide to be sure about the weight limit that your specific bar can hold.",

    "GPT_text": "Here are the **text steps** to go with the visual:\n\n# Tools & materials\n\n* Stud finder, tape measure, pencil, painter’s tape\n* 24–48″ level (or laser)\n* Power drill/driver, socket wrench\n* Drill bits: 3/16″ for pilot holes (for 5/16″ lag bolts); 1/4″ pilot if using 3/8″ lags\n* Lag bolts with washers (follow your bar’s manual; common: 5/16″ × 3″)\n* Safety glasses, step stool/ladder\n* Optional: hammer drill + masonry bit (for concrete/block), sleeve/wedge anchors\n\n# Steps (wall-mounted bar into wood studs)\n\n1. **Plan the spot**\n   Choose a clear wall. Aim for ~20–24″ of space above the bar (for chin clearance) and ~3 ft in front. Avoid doors, windows, and plumbing/electrical runs.\n\n2. **Find and mark studs**\n   Use a stud finder to locate two studs. Most are 16″ on center; confirm each stud and mark its **centerline**. If unsure, probe with a small finish nail to feel solid wood. Stay clear of lines near outlets/switches.\n\n3. **Position the first bracket**\n   Hold one bracket over the stud centerline at your target height (common bar height is 80–90″ from floor—adjust for your reach and ceiling). Level it and mark the lag-bolt holes. Painter’s tape can make a quick “template.”\n\n4. **Drill pilot holes**\n   Using a 3/16″ wood bit (for 5/16″ lags), drill straight into the stud to ~2.5–3″ depth. Wear eye protection. Brush out dust.\n\n5. **Mount the first bracket**\n   Place washers on the lag bolts and drive them through the bracket into the pilot holes. Snug them with a socket wrench—firm, but don’t overtighten.\n\n6. **Align the second bracket**\n   Measure the required spacing for your bar. Use a long level (or a straight board with a level on top) to align the second bracket at the same height on the next stud. Mark its holes.\n\n7. **Drill and mount the second bracket**\n   Drill pilots and secure the second bracket with lag bolts and washers. Recheck level across both brackets.\n\n8. **Attach the bar**\n   Set the bar onto/into the brackets per the manufacturer’s instructions. Tighten all hardware. Confirm the bar is level.\n\n9. **Safety test**\n   Pre-load the setup (e.g., hang a sandbag/backpack) and watch for movement. Then do a controlled dead-hang with bent knees. If anything shifts, retighten.\n\n10. **Aftercare**\n    Re-torque bolts after 24–48 hours and inspect monthly, especially if you do kipping/dynamic work.\n\n# Variations & tips\n\n* **Concrete or block wall:** Use a hammer drill and masonry bit sized for **sleeve or wedge anchors** (often 3/8″). Vacuum dust from holes, set anchors per spec, and torque to the manufacturer’s values.\n* **Ceiling mount:** Locate **ceiling joists** (not just drywall). Follow the same pilot/lag process into joist centers.\n* **Doorway tension bars:** Follow the product’s instructions exactly. These rely on compression—great for static hangs, but generally **not** for dynamic movements.\n* **Common mistakes:** Screwing only into drywall; missing stud centerlines; no pilot holes; mis-level brackets; using hardware that doesn’t match the bar’s instructions.\n\nIf you want a version tailored to your wall type (masonry vs. studs) or to a specific bar model, tell me the model and wall type and I’ll adapt the steps.\n",

    "prompt": "How to Do One-Armed Push-Ups Like a Pro? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Find an elevated surface. Elevated one-armed push-ups are a good way to start. The idea is that by using a raised surface, your legs take on more body weight and give you a mechanical advantage. The push-up is therefore easier to accomplish. Try a countertop, steps, couch, or wall at home. If you are outdoors, a bench or bar will do. Keep in mind that the higher you angle your body, the more body weight your legs will support and the easier the push-up will be. Don’t overdo it. Find a surface and inclination that suit your current strength level and work from there. 2. Lean in with your feet spread apart. Besides inclination, your feet will also make a difference. Namely, the push-up will be easier if they are wider apart. Stand with your feet positioned a bit wider than your shoulders, and slowly lower yourself into push-up position on the elevated surface. Some purists think that one-armed push-ups should be done with the feet together. You don’t need to follow this rule absolutely. You can also start wide and gradually move your feet inward as you progress. It’s a good idea to start with your “dominant” arm. In other words, whichever arm you favor and that is naturally stronger. You can alternate arms, as well. As you get in a starting position, let your free arm rest behind your back or against one leg. 3. Lower yourself. Slowly and deliberately lower your body until your chest almost touches the elevated surface. Your supporting arm should be bent at an acute angle of less than 90 degrees. If you want, hold this position for a few seconds. Some people advise keeping your whole body tense during the downward motion. This is supposed to help you explode upward. It will also keep your spine straight and reduce the risk of injury. Keep your bent arm back and close to your body, not jutting out like a chicken wing. Flaring your elbow out can lead to shoulder and rotator cuff injuries. Brace your abs and clench your gluteal muscles — that is, the muscles around your torso and bum. 4. Push upward. Push away from the incline and back to the starting position in a single, fluid motion. The body tension you have generated before and during this move should help you to explode upward and finish the first “rep.” Imagine that you are pushing the floor away rather than pushing yourself up. This image should let you generate more tension and engage more muscle groups. 5. Repeat and change sides. Repeat the above steps and complete a full set of reps. Then, switch to the other side. For instance, if you started with right-armed push-ups, try it with your left arm. Adjust your elevation height to suit any differences in strength. Try to do about six reps comfortably in a set to start. In other words, you should be able to do the full push-up motion in good form. If you are bold, try another set of reps after resting a few hours. Doing the reps while fresh will encourage you to use good form and build up greater power and endurance. Once you feel good at a certain level, lower the inclination and raise the weight resistance. Continue to repeat these steps until you have reached the ground.",

Wrists under shoulders, feet hip-to-shoulder width, glutes tight, ribs down, neck long.\n\n2. **Stance & Hand Placement**\n   Spread feet wider than normal for balance. Working hand is under the center of your chest (not directly under the shoulder). Non-working arm behind your back or lightly on your thigh.\n\n3. **Brace & Pack**\n   Squeeze glutes and abs hard. “Screw” the working hand into the floor to engage lats (shoulder stays down and back). Take a breath and brace.\n\n4. **Controlled Lower (Eccentric)**\n   Shift weight over the working hand. Lower in 3–4 seconds, keeping the body straight. Elbow tracks about 30–45° from your torso.\n\n5. **Bottom Position**\n   Stop with chest a fist-height from the floor. Maintain tension—no sagging hips or flared ribs. Brief pause.\n\n6. **Press (Concentric)**\n   Exhale as you drive the floor away. Keep shoulder packed, maintain body line, and continue “screwing” the hand into the ground to prevent internal collapse.\n\n7. **Lockout & Reset**\n   Finish with a straight elbow, tall plank, and level shoulders. Re-brace before the next rep.\n\n8. **Switch Sides**\n   Balance your volume left and right.\n\n---\n\n## Smart Progressions (master each for 6–10 clean reps)\n\n* **Incline one-arm push-up:** hands on a box/bench; lower the height over time.\n* **Archer push-ups:** wide hands; shift 80–90% weight to one side.\n* **Assisted one-arm:** fingertips of the free hand lightly on the floor or a yoga block.\n* **Band-assisted:** loop a band under the chest or across the working shoulder for help at the bottom.\n* **Negatives & holds:** 5–8s descents; 10–20s bottom isometric.\n\n## Programming (simple template)\n\n* 2–3 sessions/week.\n* Pick a progression where you can do **4–8 reps** with perfect form; perform **3–5 sets**, resting **2–3 min**.\n* Leave **1–2 reps in reserve**; add reps, reduce incline/assistance, or slow the eccentric to progress.\n\n## Quick Warm-Up (3–5 min)\n\nWrist circles → Scapular push-ups (10–15) → Plank with hollow body (20–30s) → Shoulder CARs (5/side).\n\n## Common Form Fixes\n\n* Hips sag or twist → widen feet, squeeze glutes, keep ribs down.\n* Elbow flares → aim elbow 30–45° from torso.\n* Shoulder shrugs up → “put the shoulder in your back pocket” (lat engagement).\n* Hand too far forward → stack wrist under chest for better leverage.\n\n> Tip: If your wrist is uncomfortable, use parallettes or push-up handles to keep a neutral wrist.\n\nIf you’d like, I can also provide a 4-week plan tailored to your current max reps.\n",

    "Gemini_text": "One-armed push-ups are an advanced exercise that requires significant strength and stability. Here's a breakdown of how to approach them, with visuals to guide you:\n\n**Step 1: Master the Standard Push-Up**\nBefore attempting one-armed push-ups, ensure you can comfortably perform multiple sets of standard push-ups with good form. Your body should form a straight line from head to heels, and your chest should nearly touch the ground. **Step 2: Wide Stance Push-Ups**\nIncrease your base of support by widening your feet. This will help you get used to a less stable position, which is crucial for one-armed variations. Keep your core engaged. **Step 3: Incline One-Armed Push-Ups**\nStart by performing one-armed push-ups against an elevated surface like a wall or sturdy table. The higher the incline, the easier it will be. This allows you to build strength in the required muscles without the full body weight. **Step 4: Negative One-Armed Push-Ups**\nGet into the top position of a one-armed push-up (with one arm on the ground and the other behind your back or on your hip). Slowly lower yourself down to the ground in a controlled manner. Use your other hand to assist yourself back up if needed, and repeat the lowering phase. This builds eccentric strength. **Step 5: Full One-Armed Push-Up**\nOnce you've built sufficient strength and stability through the previous steps, you can attempt the full one-armed push-up. Place one hand firmly on the ground, fingers pointing forward or slightly outward. Place your other hand behind your back or on your hip. Spread your feet wide for better balance. Lower your chest towards the ground, keeping your body straight and core tight. Push back up to the starting position. ",

    "prompt": "How to Do a Barbell Bench Press? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Set up the bar before lying down. Start with a very low weight if you've never done this exercise before, particularly if you don't have a spotter. In fact, some barbells are weighted without adding extra weights to the end, which may be a good place to start. You can always increase what you press later, but you don't want to injure yourself by starting with an amount you can't handle. It's best to have a spotter to catch the bar if you can, especially if you're new. You can have a friend help you at home or a weight room employee help spot you. 2. Lie down flat on your back on the bench. Position yourself so that you can easily reach the barbell once you're lying down; it should be pretty much right above your chest if possible as you don't want to reach too far. 3. Place a leg on either side of the bench. Bend your knees at a right angle. Your feet should be flat on the floor. If you're tall enough, your legs can go off the end of the bench instead of the sides. If you arch your back while your feet are on the ground, then put your feet on the bench so your heels are close to your buttocks and your knees are bent. 4. Grab the bar with both hands in an overhand grip. Place your hands a little bit wider than shoulder-width apart. Wrap your thumbs around the bar going the opposite direction of your fingers, as that will give you a steadier grip. This grip width should put your elbows at a right angle midway through the pressing motion. Don’t bend your wrists backward to support the weight of the bar. Instead, keep them aligned with the backs of your forearms. 5. Set your shoulders and pull the bar off the holder. Squeeze your shoulders together, pressing them into the bench. After ensuring you have a good grasp on the bar, lift it off the holder so you can move into the starting position. Setting your shoulders helps work them more once you start pressing the bar. 6. Extend your arms with the bar in your hands. Press the bar straight up from your chest. When your arms are all the way extended, you've reached the starting point for this exercise. Try to keep your wrists straight. It helps to hold it as low in your palm as you can while still maintaining a firm grip. 7. Breathe in and lower the bar down slowly. Take a deep breath. Draw the bar down until it touches your chest, keeping your arms tucked in close to your body as you do. Work against the weight of the bar as you bring it down. Don't allow it to slam down on your chest, as you could injure yourself. Plus, if you lower it quickly, you're missing out on some of your workout! Align the bar, your wrists, and your elbows throughout the pressing motion. If the front of your shoulders hurt during the exercise, try making your grip wider. 8. Breathe out and press up. After a short pause, push the bar back upwards, aiming for your starting position. When you reach the top of your press with your arms fully extended, pause again for just a second. As you press, think about pulling the bar apart with your hands, which will help you stabilize your shoulders and the bar. 9. Keep your hips still as you press up and down. You may be tempted to move your lower back but try to keep it in place. If it's hurting, you may need to adjust your position by putting your feet on the bench. If you need to, you can also arch your upper back a bit. Your core strength will help you hold the proper position. If you’re having difficulty keeping the form, you may have too much weight on the bar to support. 10. Repeat 8-12 times for one set. You don't want to push yourself too much, particularly as a beginner; 12 repetitions is plenty. Focus on doing the exercise correctly, which is more important. After a short rest, you can try another 1-2 sets. Aim to do strength training exercises 2-3 times a week.",

Setup the station\n\n* Flat bench centered under a rack; set J-hooks so the bar is just below straight-arm height.\n* Set safety pins ~1–2 in (2–5 cm) above your chest when arched. Load plates and use collars.\n\n2. Body position\n\n* Lie with eyes roughly under the bar. Feet flat and planted slightly behind knees.\n* Create a light upper-back arch; hips and shoulders stay on the bench.\n* Pinch shoulder blades together and down (retract/depress) and keep them there.\n\n3. Grip & alignment\n\n* Take a medium grip so forearms are vertical at the bottom.\n* Use a closed (thumb-around) grip; wrists stacked over elbows and straight, not bent back.\n* Squeeze the bar to engage lats and triceps.\n\n4. Brace & unrack\n\n* Big breath into your belly/low ribs.\n* With elbows locked, press the bar up to clear the hooks, then **pull** it forward until it’s over your shoulder joints.\n\n5. Descent (lowering)\n\n* Hold your breath; keep shoulder blades tight.\n* Lower with elbows ~45–60° from your torso.\n* Bar path goes slightly **down and forward** to touch the lower chest/sternum—light, controlled touch.\n\n6. Press (ascent)\n\n* Drive feet into the floor, keep glutes on the bench.\n* Press the bar **up and slightly back** toward over-shoulder position.\n* Exhale through or just after the sticking point; keep wrists stacked and forearms vertical.\n\n7. Lockout & rack\n\n* Finish with elbows locked over shoulders.\n* Move the bar back to the hooks deliberately and set it down under control.\n\n8. Breathing rhythm\n\n* 1 breath per rep for strength work: inhale before the descent, hold through the bottom, exhale as you press.\n\n9. Sets & loading (general)\n\n* Strength: 3–5 sets × 3–6 reps at an RPE 7–9 (1–3 reps in reserve).\n* Hypertrophy: 3–5 sets × 6–12 reps at RPE 6–8.\n\n10. Common fixes\n\n* Elbows flaring wide → tuck to ~45–60°.\n* Bar drifts toward belly → think “up and back.”\n* Hips lifting → bring feet in, squeeze glutes, keep butt down.\n* Wrist pain → tighten grip, stack wrist over knuckles, consider wrist wraps if needed.\n\n11. Spotting & safety\n\n* Use a spotter for heavy sets: liftoff on “3-2-1,” hands follow the bar without touching.\n* If lifting solo, set safeties correctly and avoid clamps only if you must bail (not recommended when maxing).\n\nIf you’d like, I can tailor grip width and cues to your limb length and current 1RM or target reps.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Be ready at all times. Timing is one of the most important aspects in blocking; a fraction of a second could be the difference between stuffing an opponent’s attack and missing the ball completely. Being in the ready position will allow you to move more efficiently when attempting a block. 2. Stand with your feet shoulder-length apart square to the net. Keeping your feet the proper distance apart will help with your footwork, another essential aspect of blocking. With your shoulders and hips square to the net you will be able to jump straight up more quickly. 3. Keep your knees bent. Keeping your knees bent is an essential part of the ready position. [1] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview By keeping your knees bent you are ready to jump immediately rather than having to lower yourself and then jump up for the block. Be careful not to get lazy and stand straight up while waiting to block. 4. Keep your arms high. Keep your arms high with your elbows around shoulder height. This also reduces the time it takes to get your arms up for the block. If they begin by your sides then they have much farther to travel to get high in the air. 5. Keep your palms facing the net. This puts them at the correct angle for blocking and again reduces the time needed to get your hands in position, making you a faster blocker. 6. Stay a half arm’s length away from the net. If you touch the net while attempting to block you will get a violation. Allow sufficient space between your body and the net to ensure you do not accidentally touch it. 7. Learn proper timing. Watch the ball before it reaches the setter and then watch the setter. After watching the setter follow the ball and watch the hitter. Watching the entire sequence rather than just the hitter or the ball will help you prepare the best block. Watch the setter for a number of clues. If the pass to the setter is in a particular position or angle then it might limit the setter’s options for the set. You can also watch where the setter’s shoulders are angled or where he/she is looking to see where they plan to set the ball. Watch the ball right after the set to help you strategize your block. If the ball is far from the net after the set then the hitter probably cannot hit straight down and will take longer to get into position. You will need to delay your jump slightly and reach high to block the shot. If the set is close to the net then you should get maximum penetration on your block attempt. If the set is very low then you will need to be quicker to jump for the block because they will hit the ball quicker. Watch the hitter for different clues. Watch his angle of approach to see where you should line up when getting ready to block. If the hitter’s shoulders and upper body rotate then they may be preparing to hit across their body. If their shoulder or elbow drops then they may be preparing for a shot. Jump right when the hitter is making contact with the ball. You may have to adjust a little depending on the ball position and particular hitter. 8. Communicate with your teammates. Most teams will designate one person (usually the middle blocker) as the blocking captain to aid in communication regarding blocking. They will coordinate the other blockers to prepare the best blocking strategy. It is important to watch the hitters and the setter as these are the people to whom your defense will need to react when attempting to block. [3] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview It is helpful for the blockers to call out the setter location and who the hitters are before the serve to prepare your team for defense. 9. Use proper footwork. It is important to move quickly on your feet in order to get your body in front of the hitter’s hitting shoulder to make the block. There are two footwork patterns that can be used to quickly get to the correct position: the sidestep and the crossover step. [4] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview The sidestep is used when the hitter is within 3–5 feet (0.91–1.5 m) of you. Take one step with the foot closest to the hitter and then follow with the other foot so they are shoulder-width apart once again. Keep your hips and shoulders square to the net as you sidestep. If it takes you more than two steps to reach the hitter then you should rather use the crossover step. The crossover step is used when you need to cover more ground, for example if the hitter is more than 5 feet (1.5 m) (1.5m) away from you. Step first with the leg closest to the hitter and then cross the other leg in front of your body. Although your hips may angle towards the hitter during the cross step, your shoulders should remain square to the net. Step again with the foot closest to the hitter to bring your feet back to shoulder-width apart and make your hips square to the net once more. 10. Jump straight up. Get yourself directly in front of the hitter shoulder of the hitter and jump straight up to attempt a block. Make sure you are balanced before jumping and jump at the same time as the hitter makes contact with the ball. 11. Angle your hands inwards as if you are grabbing the ball. Your hands should be close together (about 4-6 inches or 10-15cm between them) and angled inwards while blocking. This will direct the block back down into the opponents’ court and reduce the chances of deflection away from your other defenders. Keeping your hands together prevents the ball from going in between them. You do not want your hands to form a flat surface or else the ball can deflect in many different directions off of them. If you are close to the edge of the court, angle your outside arm and hand inwards so that if you deflect a shot it will go into the court rather than outside the lines. If you are a shorter player and cannot penetrate to the other side or cannot penetrate for another reason, keep your hands angled backwards. This is attempting to slow down the ball through touches for your defenders rather than block it. 12. Keep your fingers spread wide and relaxed but straight. Keeping them spread out makes a bigger surface area for the ball to touch and makes your fingers slightly softer so major deflections don’t occur. [5] X Expert Source Matthew Thibodeaux Professional Beach Volleyball Player Expert Interview Big deflections might make it difficult for your other defenders to get to the ball. Keeping your fingers tight, flexed and rigid will make it impossible to direct the ball. Often times the ball will bounce outside the court even if it is blocked. You want them to be straight and strong without being overly rigid. 13. Keep your wrists rigid. You will need to keep your wrists rigid to work against a hard spike. Be careful about your wrists as they can become sore or injured if you do not keep them rigid. 14. Position your arms at an angle over the net. Arms should be straight and go over the net as far as possible. This will get you closer to the ball. Even though you lose a little bit of height with this technique, it is more important to penetrate to the other side of the court than to have additional height. This way the ball will deflect back into the opponents court rather than in another direction. Make sure when you do this that you do not thrust your hips forward. Rather your upper body should be angled forward with your abs tight to pull your upper body towards the hitter. If you are a smaller blocker you should rather keep your arms straight up with your fingers angled slightly backwards. This also works if you are late and cannot penetrate to the other side.",

Ready at the net\n\n   * Feet shoulder-width, knees bent, weight on balls of feet.\n   * Hands up by your face, thumbs up, fingers spread, palms facing the court.\n\n2. Read with your eyes\n\n   * Eye sequence: ball → setter → ball → hitter.\n   * Track the set’s height and the hitter’s approach angle.\n\n3. Move to line up (close the block)\n\n   * Shuffle/crossover so your chest faces the hitter.\n   * Inside blocker leads; outside blocker “closes” to eliminate the seam.\n\n4. Time the jump\n\n   * Load as the hitter plants; explode as the hitter starts the swing.\n   * Jump late (on the rise of their shoulder), not early.\n\n5. Penetrate and press\n\n   * Reach over the net, not straight up.\n   * Thumbs slightly in, fingers spread and strong; wrists press toward the opponent’s floor.\n\n6. Seal the seam with your partner\n\n   * Call responsibilities (“line!” / “cross!”).\n   * Touch elbows/forearms together in the air to remove space between hands.\n\n7. Angle the hands to keep the ball in\n\n   * Point fingertips toward center court; shrug shoulders to avoid net contact.\n   * If tooling is likely, angle hands into the court, not out of bounds.\n\n8. Land safely\n\n   * Land on two feet, soft knees, balanced under your hips.\n   * Avoid stepping under the net; reset immediately.\n\n9. Transition to offense\n\n   * After landing, open to your setter and take your first transition step quickly.\n\n10. Common cues & fixes\n\n* “Late and over, not early and up.”\n* Don’t swing at the ball—hold a firm press.\n* If you’re getting tooled, close the seam sooner and angle hands in.\n\nIf you want, I can tailor these steps for single vs. double blocks, middle vs. pin responsibilities, or add a quick footwork drill list.\n",

    "text_ref": "1. Do wall shin raises. These are simple exercises to stretch your shins while resting your back against a wall. As long as you have a solid background for support, you can do them just about anywhere. Stand with your shoulders, back, and butt up against a wall. Place your feet away from the wall, with your heels about one foot-length in front of you. Keeping your heels on the ground, raise your toes upward. Stretch as far as possible. This is called dorsiflexion. Slowly lower your toes back toward the ground, but don’t let them touch the floor. Repeat the exercise with 10–15 reps. Once you have finished the reps, let your feet back on the floor for a quick rest, then do one or two more sets. 2. Do single leg raises. This exercise is very similar to the wall shin raise, but using only one foot at a time. It is a big more difficult because you will only be supporting yourself on one leg. This is a good exercise to build to after regular wall shin raises. [2] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Stand with your back against the wall, and rest one foot lightly against the wall. Dorsiflex with the foot on the ground for 10–15 reps. Once you are finished, switch your feet and repeat on the other leg. Because you are only using one leg at a time, you don’t need to rest between switching your legs. 3. Do heel step-downs. This is a simple exercise that you can do without a wall. You’ll be doing the same kind of dorsiflexion as the wall stand, but this time while simulating a walk. Stand up straight, not leaning against anything, with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Take a step forward, making sure only your heel plants. The step should be a normal size, so about how long you would take while walking. Hold your toes in the air, making sure the ball of your foot doesn’t get any closer than an inch to the floor. Step back to the starting position. Repeat this step with the same foot for 10–15 reps, then switch to the other leg. One variation on this exercise is to try walking around the room on your heels. Just make sure you walk very slowly, and maintain your balance. If you start to feel like you are losing your balance, rest your toes on the ground to settle. 4. Do a seated shin stretch. This is a simple stretching exercise you can do anywhere. You’ll probably want to be on a softer surface since you are on the floor. [5] X Trustworthy Source Johns Hopkins Medicine Official resource database of the world-leading Johns Hopkins Hospital Go to source Get on the floor, resting on your knees. Stretch out your feet so that your toes are pointed behind you with the tops of your feet on the floor. Gently lean backward, pushing down on your heels to stretch out the front of your leg. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds, then repeat three times. If you want to increase the stretch, do one leg at a time to increase the weight. You can also try lifting up your knees to further increase the resistance. 5. Do some heel drops. These are simple exercises that use a ledge, like a step, to provide some resistance to your foot. This is probably best to do on the bottom of a staircase, or on a small platform, rather than using a step on the top of your stairwell. Stand with your toes on the edge of a step. Make sure you have something nearby to balance yourself. Shift your weight on to one leg (say the right), then lift the other foot (the left) off of the step. Lower your right heel downward, making sure your toes point upward. Return to your starting position, then switch legs and repeat with the other foot.",

    "prompt": "How to Run in High Heels? Provide visual steps and text the steps.",
    "text_ref": "1. Choose comfortable shoes with low, wide heels. The wider the heel, the better your balance will be. Make sure they're the right fit for your foot and won't chafe or pinch. Shoes with zippers or laces (such as boots) will stay on your feet more securely while you run. If you can kick them off easily without using your hands, they're probably not secure enough to run in. 2. Learn how to walk in heels first. Even if you're a seasoned pro, each pair of shoes will feel a little different. Don't wear a particular pair of heels in any situation where you might have to run unless you have plenty of experience walking in them. 3. Strengthen your ankles and calves. This is especially important if you wear heels frequently, which can affect the shape and strength of your muscles. Most exercises are easy and simple, and some can be done sitting at your desk. Practice picking up small objects, like rolled-up socks, from the ground with your toes. Spell out the alphabet in the air with your toes, bending your ankle to move your toes in the proper shapes. Point your toes as hard as you can, then flex them. Repeat 10 times. While standing on the ground, or on the edge of a step with your heels hanging off, lift yourself up on your tiptoes. Hold for 10 seconds before slowly lowering yourself back down. 4. Keep your back straight and your head high. [3] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview It's tempting to lean forward when running, especially on an incline, but bending at the waist will constrict the flow of your breathing and the range of your hip flexors - both of which will slow you down. 5. Balance your weight between your heel and toe. Generally speaking, keeping your weight in the middle of your foot when you run will give you more sustained speed. It's natural to want to stay off your heel since it's less supported, but putting too much weight on your toes will cause your muscles to tire faster. 6. Avoid big strides. Placing your foot too far out from your body when you run can cause you to push off from your heels while they're still ahead of you. This can slow you down, harm your feet, and increase the risk of breaking your shoe's heel. Focus on short, quick strides. Visualize running through a big puddle and trying to create as little splash as possible. 7. Run as lightly as you can. Avoid putting too much pressure on your feet, for both your sake and your shoes'. Pretend you're running on top of eggshells or thin ice, trying to touch the ground as little as you can. 8. Relax your body. Believe it or not, you'll run better and faster if you don't overthink it. Too much tension will cause your muscles to tighten up and become less effective. [8] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview Focus on relaxing the muscles in your shoulders, chest and face. If you find your hands clenching, loosen them. [10] X Expert Source Kai Ng Certified Running Coach Expert Interview 9. Stick to flat surfaces. Unless you're running from danger and have a clear path to safety, stay on paved or even surfaces whenever possible. If you're not near a paved area, try to choose ground that looks relatively flat and firm. Avoid grass. It may look flat, but even a well-manicured lawn can be dangerous to run on if your heel sinks into the soil. 10. Watch for small holes and grooves in the ground. Even a paved surface may have holes or cracks that can trap thinner heels and trip you up. Keep a close eye on the ground in front of you, but make sure to watch where you're going too. 11. Avoid steep inclines. A downhill slope might seem like it would help you run faster, but it will put your feet at an even more awkward angle, and may in fact slow you down. Uphill slopes will be more strenuous for your leg muscles, which will make you run slower as well. 12. Don't jump unless you have to. Unless there's no other way to get around an obstacle, avoid even small jumps, as they will put extra pressure on your feet and shoes, and you will have to regain your balance after landing. It also may be harder to see the ground ahead when you are jumping over a large obstacle.",

Choose the right heels\n\n* Pick a stable pair: block heel or wedge, 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm), secure ankle strap, good fit.\n* Add non-slip sole grips if the bottoms are slick.\n\n2. Prep & warm up (1–2 min)\n\n* Ankle circles (both directions), calf raises, gentle hamstring/calf stretch.\n* Check straps/buckles are snug.\n\n3. Posture setup\n\n* Stand tall: ears over shoulders, shoulders over hips, ribs stacked, neutral pelvis.\n* Engage your core lightly; look where you’re going (not at your feet).\n\n4. Start with short, quick steps\n\n* Keep strides small to stay balanced.\n* Aim for a light, quick cadence rather than long reaches.\n\n5. Soft forefoot landing\n\n* Touch down gently near the ball of the foot, then roll through—avoid stabbing the heel first.\n* Keep toes pointing forward; don’t let ankles collapse inward.\n\n6. Use compact arm swing\n\n* Elbows ~90°, swing close to the body to counterbalance without twisting your torso.\n\n7. Pick safe surfaces\n\n* Prefer smooth, dry, even ground.\n* Avoid grates, cobblestones, grass, wet tile, and steep slopes.\n* If you must cross hazards, slow to a walk.\n\n8. Braking & turning\n\n* To slow: shorten steps, keep torso tall, don’t lean back.\n* For turns: take several tiny steps (no sharp pivots on a planted heel).\n\n9. Emergency stop & recovery\n\n* If you wobble: plant both feet shoulder-width, knees soft, lower your heels toward flat, then reset.\n* If a heel catches: stop, step back out, don’t yank forward.\n\n10. Cool down & care\n\n* Walk it off for 30–60 seconds, stretch calves/arches.\n* Inspect tips/heel caps; swap to flats if feet feel fatigued.\n\n### Practice Drills (build skill before full running)\n\n* March in place in heels (30–60s).\n* Walk–jog intervals: 10–20m jog, 20–30m walk; repeat 4–6x.\n* Figure-8 weaving around two cones/chairs to train controlled turns.\n\n### Safety Notes\n\n* Running in heels increases risk of ankle/knee injury—only do brief sprints when necessary.\n* Never run in very high, narrow stilettos or loose shoes.\n* Carry foldable flats as a backup.\n\nIf you’d like, I can generate alternate visuals (e.g., a printable poster or a horizontal storyboard) or tailor the steps to your specific heel height.\n",

[1] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source Practice holding your breath for long periods of time out of water first so you can practice proper breathing techniques. 2. Relax your mind and body. While lying down or sitting, focus on clearing your mind of all extra thoughts and worries. Don't move your body around; sit as still as possible. This lowers your blood pulse. A lowered pulse means your body is using less oxygen. [2] X Trustworthy Source HelpGuide Nonprofit organization dedicated to providing free, evidence-based mental health and wellness resources. Go to source Your body needs oxygen to move and function. The less you move, the less oxygen your body will need. First, practice holding your breath without moving. Then, add in simple, slow movements like walking to train your body to conserve oxygen. This will prepare your body to dive and swim with less air. 3. Inhale slowly using your diaphragm. You should feel your belly rise instead of your shoulders if you're using your diaphragm to inhale. Your diaphragm is the muscle attached to the bottom of your lungs that helps expand your lungs to hold more oxygen. [3] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Start inhaling for 5 seconds at a time. Then, increase by a few seconds every time you inhale. You will be stretching out your lungs and increasing their ability to hold more air. Practicing deep breathing on land can help improve how long you can hold your breath underwater. [4] X Expert Source Hayley Church Aquatic Manager Expert Interview Puffing up your cheeks does not mean that you have enough oxygen. It makes you use face muscles that spend oxygen instead of conserving it. 4. Exhale a little at a time. While you hold your breath, let out little puffs of air at a time. You will feel your body try and force you to exhale completely. These little convulsions are your body telling you that carbon dioxide is building up in your lungs. [5] X Trustworthy Source Cleveland Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals Go to source Push out as much air as possible when you've finished to get rid of any extra carbon dioxide. As you hold your breath, your body turns oxygen into carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is toxic to your body and can cause you to pass out. Once you get past the convulsions, your spleen releases more oxygen-filled blood into your bloodstream. Hold your breath past this point to be able to hold it even longer. [6] X Trustworthy Source Science Direct Online archive of peer-reviewed research on scientific, technical and medical topics Go to source 5. Repeat inhaling and exhaling. Every time you repeat a breath cycle, push yourself to go a little longer each time. Breathe in and out for two minutes at a time, keeping yourself at a calm and even pace. You are training your body to handle being without oxygen. [7] X Trustworthy Source Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Main public health institute for the US, run by the Dept. of Health and Human Services Go to source 6. Breathe correctly several times. Before going underwater, spend five minutes breathing in and out slowly like you've practiced. Relax your body as well while sitting or standing in the shallow end of a pool or body of water. [8] X Trustworthy Source PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health Go to source 7. Dive slowly below the surface. Take one deep breath through your mouth and lower yourself below the surface of the water. Keep your mouth and nose closed while underwater. Use your fingers to hold your nose shut if you need. Staying relaxed is important since there is more risk in holding your breath underwater than on land. 8. Resurface slowly. Once you've reached your body's limit, swim or push yourself to the surface. Blow out any extra air as you rise so that you can take a fresh breath immediately. Before diving again, take another two to five minutes to do a few breath cycles to get your body back to normal oxygen levels. If you begin to panic at any moment, relax and surface. Panicking can lead to accidental inhalation underwater, which can cause drowning. 9. Add in movement once you're comfortable. Swimming and forcing your body to dive deeper will use up more oxygen. Don't try to exert yourself right away. When diving, you want to remain as relaxed and calm as possible, keeping your pulse low. Swimming is the complete opposite. Your pulse will be high and your muscles moving quickly. 10. Measure your progress by distance and not time. As you begin to go longer without breath, avoid using a timer or counting seconds because you will mentally psych yourself out. Instead, measure how far you can swim across the pool or how deep you can go before needing air. If you want to keep track of your time, have a friend time you instead. 11. Have another person nearby while you practice. Practicing alone is dangerous because you cannot help yourself to safety if you pass out or begin choking or drowning. To be extra safe, make sure that your partner is CPR trained so if there's an emergency, they're able to help you out. 12. Stay in shallow waters at first. This way you can stand or sit while going underwater. Treading water requires extra energy that uses your precious oxygen. It's also easier to get to the surface quickly in case you need air or have an emergency. 13. Listen to your body. If your vision begins to fade or you feel light-headed, go to the surface immediately. Risking your personal safety is not as important as a few extra seconds underwater.",

Get a buddy & set the scene\n\n* Only practice with a trained buddy watching you the entire time.\n* Use a shallow pool where you can stand. No open water. No breath-holds in bathtubs or alone—ever.\n\n2. Relax your body first (2–3 minutes)\n\n* Sit or stand poolside; shoulders loose, jaw unclenched.\n* Breathe gently in and out (nose in, mouth out).\n* **Do not hyperventilate.** No rapid breathing beyond your normal rhythm.\n\n3. Take a quality final breath\n\n* One normal exhale to neutral.\n* Inhale slowly “from the belly up”: diaphragm expands, then ribs, then upper chest.\n* Lips closed, tongue resting on the roof of the mouth to seal the airway.\n* Don’t “pack air” or force extra breaths.\n\n4. Start in the shallow end, face in water\n\n* Hold the pool edge or stay within arm’s reach of the wall.\n* Let your body float; keep movements minimal to save oxygen.\n\n5. Equalize and stay gentle if you submerge\n\n* If you dip slightly lower, equalize your ears (pinch nose, swallow/valsalva softly).\n* Avoid going deep; this is about calm breath-holding, not depth.\n\n6. Conserve energy\n\n* Stay still or use tiny, slow frog kicks.\n* Keep your head neutral; relax your neck and hands.\n* Focus on a simple, calm thought—no counting games that make you tense.\n\n7. Surface early—on the first strong urge to breathe\n\n* Ascend slowly with one hand up.\n* Exhale a small stream of bubbles as you rise (don’t blow everything out).\n\n8. Recover breathing at the surface\n\n* Hold the wall or rest on a buoy.\n* Do 3–5 cycles of recovery breaths: quick, gentle inhale through the mouth → long, relaxed exhale (like saying “sss”).\n* Stop immediately if you feel dizzy, tingly, confused, or nauseous.\n\n**Safety red lines**\n\n* Never practice alone; never hyperventilate or “air-pack.”\n* Avoid prolonged or competitive holds; do not push past discomfort.\n* Not advised for children, pregnant people, or anyone with heart, lung, ear, or neurological conditions without medical clearance.\n* If you want to go beyond basic breath-holds, seek a certified freediving or swim-safety instructor.",

Take a few deep, slow breaths to calm your nervous system. This helps reduce your heart rate and conserves oxygen. **Step 2: Take a Deep Breath**\nWhen you're ready, take a full, deep breath, filling your lungs completely. Avoid hyperventilating, as this can be dangerous. Just one good, deep inhalation is sufficient. **Step 3: Enter the Water Calmly**\nSubmerge yourself gently and calmly. Sudden movements can cause you to use oxygen faster. Keep your body as still as possible. You can pinch your nose or use a nose clip to prevent water from entering. **Step 4: Stay Relaxed Underwater**\nWhile underwater, focus on remaining relaxed. Tensing up will use more oxygen. Try to keep your movements minimal. The urge to breathe will eventually come; acknowledge it but try to gently push past it for a short time if you can. ",
